Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
There.
Have fun tonight?
The "real you".
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
You are so completely unbalanced.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
I'm missing something.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You know French?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Number one.  She hates smokers
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Where ya goin?
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
What'd he say?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Are you following me?
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Start a band?
Wholesome.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
The Partridge Family?
What?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No.
You tell me.
It's just something I had.  You know
That ' s completely adorable!
I know.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Tempestuous?
Macbeth, right?
Kat a fan, too?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
He's the devil's child...
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
I could be gone for years.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
No...
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
Chief says -- how many?
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I suppose we're both old men now.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What's he doing?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
...delusions and paranoia.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
I can't take you to my place.
What about back home?
Are you alright?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
What are you doing?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Only one guys checked in?
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Who's there?
What's wrong?
You know what that is, right?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You goin' to the escort service?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Is it drug related?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
Stop it.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Promise?
Okay, til tonight.
How old are your kids?
Okay.  You ready?
Are you married?
Give me the address!!
Who is he?
This all you want?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
I know.
New York.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll send a cop back for you.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah?  What kind?
Get outta here!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Okay. 
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes, I thought so.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
I'm having a party tomorrow.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
That's true.
Yeah?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
I'm candy...
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
Where's ganz?
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Yeah?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
No way to start a partnership.
Luther was part of the gang?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
You made that move, huh?
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Where's the goddamn car?
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah?
That's what you say, Cates...
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
A cop...
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Hey...
How hot are they?
We got a lot to talk about.
When?
How you doing, man?
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
...We're saved!
...would you like a drink?
Who are you?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
We have to save the world.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
What's she doing?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Uh... at least fifty.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Yeah?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I'm sorry..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
What did you say? What did you do?
Is that all?
To save the world.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Where you going?
You're nothing but a... a...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Tell me...
Have you identified it?
Talk English Doc.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I want your best man on this!
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
...Not far, now.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Your clothing reeks of it.
Okay, I believe you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
What happened to you?
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
A fellow investor.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You brought the money?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
Alright, Tom.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
What?
What the fuck are you.. ?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Who is Machine?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Keep moving.
You got absolute zero.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Look, you cocksucker...
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
How long you been working there?
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
I'm not a cop.
Not quite.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
How old are you?
A daughter.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Who is he, his name?
What's next?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
He's odd.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Nothing remotely like this.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Yes... I remember Mary
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Rick...I can't.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
You just feel sorry for me.
What the hell was that?
I don't get it.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Hey man, we're all sorry...
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Feeling better now?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Where are we going?
How was the meeting?
Very funny.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Who's Jacob?
They think I'm nuts.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
We're stuck tight!
Well?
What about down?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Who?
Who?
No.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
This spring.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Mmm.
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Open the door, will ya?
Open the door. We're late.
Yeah.
What then?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No what?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
How about a Big Mac?
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Huh?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
On what you pay me?
You? Why?
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No problem. Look, I...
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I'm sorry.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
I know your parents.
Of course! I would've heard.
What happened?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Hold on!
He's asleep. We were up very late.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
You talked to Jack?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Where's Ma?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Call it what you want.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Then who shot him?
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Daddy...
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Can we do that?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
How many others killed?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Finally, we can bargain.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Someone should give you a raise.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
Other way around, sir.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
What's the story?
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Simon just ejected!
Now!
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That's not possible.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
He's carrying a bomb.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Striker.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Ah, won't you sit down?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Both pilots!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No. No one that I know of.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Ted, what are you doing here?
What's the matter?
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Excuse me, Sister?
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
In there.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
Stop the car.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--

Shit!
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
How can I go?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Could it be intelligent?
Amy.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's right.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
I hope you're right.  I really do.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Still nothing from the colony?
What's he scanning for?
One of us?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
So.
I told them to fall back...
What's the question?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Seventeen meters.
Let's go!  Let's go!
They're in the approach corridor.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Ellen.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Why not?
What's that?
The marriage!
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Hardly.
You have leave to try.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
What is it?
No! No! No!
Why not?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
There's a young girl to see you.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Who was that?
Why not?
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
It is miraculous.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
This is not his handwriting.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
When, may I ask?
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
What a charming idea. May I see?
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Why not?
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Oh, thank you.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Yes.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Are you playing a trick on me?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Opera? Opera!
That's right.
What?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What?
Yes.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
I'm sorry. No.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Do you have a daughter?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
Shall I answer it?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
With the tenors.
And that's all?
And that's it. Do you have it?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
What do you want?
Well?
All Vienna has heard that.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You mean that play?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
That lady is back, sir.
How did he look?
What exactly did he call out?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
He's not?
Yes.
And what else?
Dr. Hirsch?
Mr. Kessler?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
What do you dream about?
How old are you?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Closet.
But...
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Feeling better?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Miss Price.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
You're in a hospital in London.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
That's a wolf's head.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Hello.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Jack, we'd better go.
What the hell was that all about?
Did you hear that?
No, but he was on the moors.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
It's moving.
Oh shit. What is that?
It sounds far away.
Nice to see you.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm not listening!
Shut up, you zombie!
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Jack, are you really dead?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Remember the Alamo?
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Where's Matt?
He has?
What's the matter, Charlie?
I remember once when your account checked.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Oh!
Thanks.
Fifty thousand dollars!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Yes, of course.
Good morning.
Longer.
Yes?
Helen!
Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Yes, sir.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
He's at a board meeting.
Hello, Helen!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
He was in the bank yesterday.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
So you were home last night?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
We got a problem here, brother?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Damn!
How many of them did he kill?
But if we take their money and supplies...
Beg pardon?
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Well?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
The safe. Now.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Then why can't I go in there?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
That would have made an impression.
Hell of a war.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
We're doing this for Ma.
That he was.
Can't argue that.
But still died.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Zee.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Don't turn around.
Yes?
Was it worth it?
That's what I would have done.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
With my money!
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
What the hell is that sound?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Yes?
I can't.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Are we here?
Pull out, goddamnit!
That's nice.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's good-looking.
Are you using minoxidil?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But where?
Doesn't he live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Call me please, Patrick.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
I said we are totally booked.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Interesting.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Forget it.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Jean? What?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Where are you?
So, what do you do?
Welt...it depends, why?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Have you consulted a psychic?
Nothing.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
What?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
Yes.
He does? You're sure?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You think so?
Is it over?
I'm just screwed.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
He's your boss. He's not your --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
That was -- different.
Look at this.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
That'll be a test, won't it?
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Milo?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Cool!
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
I heard what happened.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
Gary, hi.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
I think you should go.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Did I say something?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Why?!
Is that how Larry feels?
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Did you tell Alice?
So how'd you like the house?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Who're these guys?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Care for some saki?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
I can't see a bloody thing.
I don't get it.
Oh, yes you are.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Austin, what's your point?
I love you, Austin.
Kiss me.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We've got a lot of work to do.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Quite impressive.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
How's Austin?
I just don't see it.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Hope...
Fear ...
How long have I been here?
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
May I help you, madam ...
Then you can't come in.
Quite a collection.
People, too.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
I thought we were on our way.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
I wasn't about to.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
I thought you played by the rules.
I told Mother I took care of you.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Steed
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
This man -- did you see him?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
In your operation.
Are you alright, young man?
The last one you'll ever see.
Rules are made to be broken.
You said ... one shot.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Does Cole know about this?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
You're kidding.
I've decided not to run for President.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Cole?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Are any of those right?
It's on the tenth floor.
Oops!
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Rick, I'm concerned.
What's this?
He look familiar?
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
You're late again, Rick.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
It doesn't go like that.
Been ripping off fire stations?
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Ready?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Hey.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I was doing my job.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Hi.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
What the hell are you doing here?
Nice bunch of guys.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Did I say thanks?
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
I have a job.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
What?
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
He just wants to --
They're waitin' man.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Yeah? When was the last time?
Look, I'm sorry I --
Didn't think you'd make it.
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
I'm working on it.
Alderman Swayzak.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
Yeah.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Keep trying.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Yeah, him.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
What's wrong with him?
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
My tap shoes.
I would like to change your name.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
But the line has to be drawn.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Word!!!
I'm feelin' dis'!
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
So what's up with you?
Manray!
What point is that?
Sounds risky to me.
What is your problem?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
So they can be on TV.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
How's the food?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Money and nothing else?
Not her, the one with the little...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
The good stuff.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
How did you get this gig?
You leave something out?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Where are you bound for?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
O'Grady.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Good gracious!  What is this?
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
No.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
You want my heart?
Will we always leave it at this?
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I feel the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Does this assignment interest you?
Was he cheated?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Bill Styles...
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
You killed him you fucking faggot --
You did Basic here?
There's no need...
You smoke, Ray?
That'd be my reaction too --
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
We don't need the tapes --
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
Tom, where are you going --
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
Stay where you are.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Hostile and uncooperative.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
What is that?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Dunbar.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
We're fucked, I know --
That's a fantastic idea --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No.
Four --
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Nah.
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
He said what?
Pike never confessed.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Who, Levi --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
What the fuck happened to you --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Great, great. That's fantastic.
See! The big guy likes it.
Bloom like a flower?
What is this place?
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
You get the eye?
How would you describe him?
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
You owe me three-fifty.
When did you ever work in an office?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Why not religion, Dad?
It's unbelievable.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
I was drying out.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I don't believe it!
Oh. Oh.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Mom?
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
The sets were good.
Yes.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
And...
When?
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He wants the money from your bank.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
They go. John. They go.
They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
Fine.
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
No.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Some... What does that mean?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You don't understand me.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I'm sorry.
What?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Something else.
No. What? No. I know.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Lazarus?
Is your niece older than 12?
More cough syrup?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
I keep the heat on.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
YOU SHUT UP!
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
LET ME GO!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Could you do somethin' for me?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Sorry.
How you feelin' today?
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
He tapped that.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
So...  That your first time?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Hey.
I feel better. Do you?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Back-up.
Why?
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Nick... You up?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Squid?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Are you expecting anyone?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
What happened?
What's he saying?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's very small.
What's in the box?
Nick, you can't do this.
Joyce?
You all right?
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
And I'm supposed to care?
You'll get Ich killed.
Keep the change.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Because I want you to tell me.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
Would you like to be modified?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
But not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I've done some questionable things.
What, Sebastian?
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I want to do it.
Six, huh?
Yeah.
She was gonna get away.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Okay, but...
Next.
I think I have no money.
Thank you very much.
You sure?
What shows?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It's artificial?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
In your opinion.
I can imagine.
Did you cry when your father died?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
They could clean around the arrangement.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
But then how can you...
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
You know what I think?
Bad?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
How many questions did it take?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
Know what a turtle is?
How come you were in my truck?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What about friends?
You look... better.
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
So far?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Wait!  Wait!
Watching television in color.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
I didn't know that.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Get out!
Now, get out!!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
The guy with the underpants!
About clothing?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Hey, Eve!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
No!  Not crazy!
What about her?
You wanted to see me!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
Eve?!
Really?  Okay!
Like a painting?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Uh-huh.
You have very nice ceilings.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I don't think so.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Bye, Troy!
You don't look thirty-five.
What?  What is it?!
Whatcha looking at?
I do alright.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Oh, my God!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
To go up.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Oh, no.
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
Get the presents and do the lights.
What did you wish for, Adam?
If we still have one.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
We stay down here.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
I want him to at least see the sky!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Give me your hand.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
You're serious, aren't you?
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Go to the bathroom.
What's it to you?!
Gay.
And if we can't find him?
To get some frozen poultry.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Adam!!
Buy it from me?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Frank. Come in.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay?
You're all through with this now?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Shit. You better tell me something.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
THEN WHAT?
What do you want from me?
Do you like that?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you like me?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
Oh shit.
Nice guy. Who's he?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
Falling.
Yes.
Yes. Frank--
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
What do you want to do?
Do you love me?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
I guess I should go.
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Frank gone?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God, you scared me.
No, you're right.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
How is Central these days?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Yeah, but.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
What's with Mike?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
Did you see her undressed?
What am I going to do?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Jeffrey? Why?
You like mysteries that much?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Probably not. No. Why?
Look Jeffrey.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
Look again for fuck sake!
Hello.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
No ma! No!
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
I don't know they just always need it.
That was way easier than I thought.
Give the guy a shot.
He isn't to be touched.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Fuck you!
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We'll keep going, Roc.
Hello? You there?
What is it my son?
I believe these young men are right.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Just be natural, goddamit.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
Why?
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
But he didn't say anything.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the manager?
There's another stocker, right?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Yeah.
What about them?
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Where was I?
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I think we better go home.
We've got sixteen dollars.
I had to give some to Inez.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What do you think?
Shit, Dignan.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Do you like Inez?
You're all clear.
Freeze!
What are you talking about?
Like amnesia.
How big is it?
What's he in for?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
You mean a safecracker?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
How does that feel?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Absolutely.
Are you serious?
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
Anthony, I --
Bob, where you going?
Why not?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
You OK, Bob?
What are you doing?
Jesus, Bob.
What?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Well, what do you think?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
The guy is fucking insane.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
This is natural.
Did we get it?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
The weed.
Bob, that makes no sense.
This could be a trap.
Not in that car you're not.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Dignan.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
I'm sorry, Bob.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Applejack drove.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
He said you ran away from home.
The grammar?
Oh, yeah.
Why?
He left his sweater.
Is that your chiquita?
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
That's not gonna fly.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
What?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Why not? It was just money.
She say what time I should call?
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
That's not what happened to your parents.
Front. Use your teeth.
You still should've moved.
What do you want?
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
You called it in?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I'll get the book.
It's just a nightmare.
But you're sure?
So...
Where --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
You hear me? I believed you.
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
That's a lie!
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Mr. Nevins?
How long have you worked for the agency?
What kind of problems?
Believed what?
So he fooled you.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Did you?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Anything?
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Yes. In that order.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
What are they doing?
Peace?!
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
He won't come.
What news of the north?
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
Rest, William.
I don't want to be a martyr.
They're coming!
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I have faced him. Have you?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I do not confess.
Did it work?
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I need you so much! I love you!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Why did you?
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Who would do such a thing?
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
No dances, just tell me.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Please, mom. People will talk.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Are you stupid or what?
Oh God... what did we do?
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
I know, but...
Why are you doing all this for me?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Ha! Where's that?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
There's one major hole in your story.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
What time is it?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Smells like sex in here.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Just get out, didja?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
So you decided to go to America.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Here you are.
I'd better be going.
Hello, Rick.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Do you know where they are?
Rick?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
A franc for your thoughts.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
For the last time, put them on the table.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Hello, Sam.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Where is Rick?
When will he be back?
I must find out what Berger knows.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Yes?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
No. It's all arranged.
My bill.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
This is hardly the time or the place.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Ho, diplomatist!
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Hello, Louis.
Oh, but I just told you. --
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Sam's piano.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
Where were you last night?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Rick! Rick, help me!
You ever going to bed?
No. Not me, boss.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Save some for tomorrow.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
No.  that was the last one.
Got to follow the paper path here.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
I have to.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I got married.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Come on.  Try.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
You okay?
When's the next Jumbo?
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
When'd you start working here?
Trying.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
And never take.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
You are one sick fucker.
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
To Wilson.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Take your time.
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
I've never seen a lobster.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
At least you were never lonely.
You don't miss it?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Do you think she'll be all right?
Hi...
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
That's true.
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
What's a nanny do?
What's an immigrant?
Uh... it's the end of October.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
At what altitude?
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
So. What should I do now?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
It looks like scurvy.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
You okay, Rose?
But you don't look very happy.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
*What* view?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
So how'd you get caught?
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
She had you tempting fate.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
We were back on.
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Masters of our own destiny.
Shit.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You'll be there?
Jake --
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Why not?
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Sorry, I --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
What the hell's his problem?
You need to get a haircut.
He's gone.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Your mess.
Meet me at my place later.
We're working for the King.
Uh...
We're getting a little old for running.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
And we got rid of the red head.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Can't say.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Special Agent?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Did he buy it?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
It's just insurance.
You're shaking.
The Indian rope-trick.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
What?!
She went back to South Africa.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I found her in bed with someone.
Good night?
Where did you get it?
I want to hear it.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
The door, Jack.
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
What?
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Why did you take the money?
I've lived there.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want you to forget what I said.
How much do you owe?
And your hand too.
I don't think we should meet again.
How are you?
You've been avoiding me.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
What happened to Bella?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
You use two alternating, don't you?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Thanks for the information.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
What was that, I didn't hear...
What the hell?
Fuck that shit.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Hey, bomb...
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
That's it.
And you can only do it once, right?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Wha?
Veil nebula.
I need a diameter approximation.
You know what I think about, Talby?
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
What happened, Doolittle?
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Oh yeah?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Sir?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Who are you?
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Who's Camille?
Can I say something in my defense?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Out there.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
No...
Sophy?  Are you okay?
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
What do you want?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Morning, Sunshine...
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
That's odd...
Yeah.
A little what?
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Gotta go.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
You left out condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
What happens if you level with her?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
I want you on call here.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Thanks, miss.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Pick a song, Hawk.
I-I c-can't...
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Ann Arbor?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Beg pardon?
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
What happened to your eye?
How much longer is this gonna last?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's alright... I understand.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
People aren't that simple.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Where are you going?
What's "Cellar Door"?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Don't you watch the news?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Who is the boss?
Can anyone else see him?
Nothing.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
People get hurt.
That I did it again.
Because I'm so horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
I can see him right now!
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Excuse me?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Christ. Is that an axe?
How did this happen?
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
Loretta, don't do that.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Bye mom.
I hate her!
What?
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Oh! What is it?
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Half watch dog?
What do you whistle?
That was for you.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna work at all.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Send in the next girl. 
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Oh, Rufus!
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Oh, won't you reconsider...
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
They have noble faces.
You won't be long?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Yes.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
I want my man back.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Oh yes?
Treves. Well done.
What is it, Treves?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
You never mentioned his mental state.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
Merrick...
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
The hospital?
Who are they of?
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
My home.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Watery headed bunch.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
WHY?
I've never LOVED anybody!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
You're as bad as my father.
We mustn't let him land!
Just give me a hand.
But you don't realize....
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
But --
Is there nothing men can do?
No... we don't...
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
A lot of people like our singing.
He wants to kill US!
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Is there something the matter with it?
Have you done this sort of thing before?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
How deep IS the ocean?
You talking piffle, son?
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
What's the matter with them?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
I AM one, Dad!
It can't do you any HARM...
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
You're wasting your time.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
My brother blacksmiths!
It's a tradition.
I must KILL! Kill!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well... I'm game.
And you've got BOTH axes?
And something to sharpen them with?
Yeah.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
I remember.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
How are you today?
How are you today?
Really? Because --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
So you like bookstores, huh?
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
It's pretty.
Well, I should probably get going.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
So, um --
Oh?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I scoured the city for it.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
It's very late.
Well, you're married.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
I know.
Hi there.
Oh God, how horrid.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
What do we do?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I wish we did. You married?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I knew.
What if you stay this time?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
What took you so long?
Yeah?
I probably got the same thing as you.
Hi, it's Joel.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Hi.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Definitely!
See you later, alligator.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
It's stopped.
Oh.
Mary...
Order me a pastrami for after?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Oh, hi.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
It's an apartment.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
A traveler, eh?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
No, I guess not.
Extraordinary!
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
You're the best?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
I can see why they sent you along.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
Will it work?
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
Is that an offer?
Can you shut it down?
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Please...
Please... kill...
90 over 50 and falling... .
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
Patch me through to him.
...I don't want to die...!
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
What does it say?
I can see that, what're they for?
Yes.
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
What about it?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
The "Other Place," what is that...?
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
You... You can't do that!
Your eyes...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Sir.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
That's an affirmative.
Oxygen is not the problem.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Miller...
Weir can't be alive.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Can you see a body?
Where is she?
The safety circuit's failed!
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
What are you doing here?
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
You got a chisel round here?
We're working as hard as we can --
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed?... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
You're hot!
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Apparently I can disappear.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
You two need a time-out.
Then what is it?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
I can... make it work.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
How much did they cost?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
I can't find it, mon!
Easy, mon.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Any problems?
Jeff you have company!
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Hey, Mike?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
All right... where did you see her?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Hey, Rat.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
You'll always remember your first time.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Does that ever happen?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Where's Doug?
Sometime?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
I couldn't make it in time.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
It's very warm out tonight.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Aren't your parents asleep?
No. That's okay.
...I've got to go home.
John Bonham?
I made a fool of myself.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
That's good...
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
NO! Stop talking like that.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
The airport is over there!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
You realize...
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
What?
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
I will not die because of him!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Stop it.
We shot a skunk.
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
You seem mighty collected about this.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Ohhh.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
You wanna see, baby?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Will these boards hold?
What?
Is it gassed up?
Open?
Nine?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Got 'cha!
Fine, Chief.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's go.
Let's go!
Go! Go!
Get to your cars!
I admire your strength.
Her name is Charlie.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
What did we say about lying?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
You know what I mean.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
...So what do you think?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Are you... are you hungry?
See you next weekend?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
What?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Harry.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
You don't know what you want.
Frances...
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
What?
Jesus.
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Is that why you did it?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Where are we, mean man?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
There's just one more thing.
Frances, You're crazy.
Frances! Frances!
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
That would be okay.
Shit!
...Is that not true?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
But I want to. I'm trying!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Yes...?
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
What?
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You were with him at the end.
And he drove me to mine.
Nice.
Come warm yourself if you like.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Friend?
What is this?
You dance so beautifully together.
Must've been a terrible row.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
You make me weak.
Our decision. Together.
I've no choice
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Professor?
Quite a few.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
You can't. Death is God's will!
That's blasphemy!
Quite a place.
Paracelsus?
What is your name?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Cabin B is ready.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Oh, my God...
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
Filmmaker.
What'll you do when you leave here?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Help you clean up?
It sounded like Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
How come?
I'm sorry.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Thanks.
Chance to get even?
You just had some lucky shots.
Holy shit...
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
I love you.
Looks like a storm.
It's beautiful...
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Why do you want to stop?
What's this guy's problem?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Who's this?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Who else?
What are you going to do?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
What's this stuff?
I promise.
That happens, you'll get it back.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
See ya.
-- you got your sink --
-- see this, television!
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
What the fuck was that about?
Richie? You okay?
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Do they have a waterbed?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
I don't know, you just passed out.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
That's what you think?
How?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
How are you?
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
The woman I saw you with...
But are there... I mean, how many...
Who's...  Lieuten --
Wow...
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Permission to leave, sir?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Come on, Montgomery...
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
The Navy Cross...
Chances of recovery?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
"In Washington..."
They're more afraid of you.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Last time I didn't.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
She part of the training?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
O'Neil...
We're fucked.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
I take it this file is still open.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Where's Audrey?
Me!? You where the one...
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
What are you doing?
Think we can fit up in there?
I'll take them all.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Your old sweetheart?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
Not for a long time, now.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
They didn't make it.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
What sample?
I need you to trust me.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
What's with the chewing gum?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
What'd they say?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
This is it?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He wants to THINK!?
What's happened?
And note the sucked in gut.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
A boy comes to the door.
"Go into the cloud! ...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
He always has to make the big entrance.
Hi Brandon.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
What does the Omega 13 do?
What do you mean?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
What's the weather like outside?
Covalent... Right. So...
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
A hologram...
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
THAT'S why you built this ship?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Oh, they're so cute.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
They're still behind us...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
You're playing your good side.
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
I... certainly, but-
You... You mean Earth?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Commander...
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Continue forward, sir?
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Well, what have you thought?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Sir, I think no such thing.
What's your advice, Alexander?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
They are... friends of Congress.
Makes you gag.
Unofficially, General Greene.
Any word from Canada?
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
No, please; an advance on your salary.
And how rusty are these muskets?
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Martha... what?
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
What the hell are we doing?
George, you know I only love you, but...
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
All people have rights!
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
I reserved a Cadillac.
You see the paper?
Who?
You get life for kidnapping.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
Get something going there.
That's all there is to it, huh?
I need the money.
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
I'm working on a few things.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What?
You say look at you?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You have a card in here?
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's it? That's your movie?
What does that mean?
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
What's it called?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
She looks familiar.
You don't even know these guys.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
One we're producing.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
It's not one of these?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Were you scared up there?
I told you not to -–
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -–
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
What's so great about Sweden?
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Where from?
One more?
Guess I'll just keep working.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Smokes?
Did you?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
If you get it back in one piece.
But how long?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the hell happened!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Don't fall asleep.
What's slow?
What'd he look like?
Stay away. Or else.
Candy?
Coffee?
She was sailing up north, right?
Who?
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
The ah... the radio's out.
Couldn't sleep.
The what?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Murphy to Epps.
Over the gold.
What happened?
Too deep to anchor out there.
It's funny.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
I don't know.
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Can't find the shotgun.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
No, no. You got leak.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Guess.
About what?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
And what can you tell us about this... 
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
That guy rules!
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Do you want something to drink?
When did I say I hated you?
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You're better at it.
What does it stand for?
He's insane!
Ew, look at this...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Not really...
There he is...
It's a surprise.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Look, we have to get these...
Don't you want nice stuff?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
So, whaddya think?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Didn't they tell you?
Oh, how "punk."
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
I - I'd really rather not...
I don't think so...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
So, why did you bring this along?
What did you tell that girl?
It's not hopeless...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Aren't you going to get that?
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What are you doing here?
What's up?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Talk to us about it...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Thank you, doctor.
Seymour?
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
You've never built in Africa.
Pleasant journey?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
That's a terrible idea-
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Very good indeed.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Finish your tour?
I don't suppose I could watch.
What a good week.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Goddammit!
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
I'll have to.
How many do you think they've killed?
I am also liaison between these two.
For you.
Do you love her?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
How many cattle?
Janosz?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
No, you didn't, Frank.
Hello, Peter.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Then why have you come?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
These boys aren't playing around.
Can I have some of your water?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
What's your story, Pete?
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
She's moving!
Now where are you going?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Like a used car salesman.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
You must have gotten the last copy.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
That is one speedy mutt.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I want you to have this. 
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
May I please see the storage facility?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Did you see anything?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Who?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What is it?
I told you it's real.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Who was the architect?
Me, too.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
That's what you told me two days ago!
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
For the gods, spit it out!
What is that... wailing?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Give away food?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
The Senate too?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
You need to come home!
This is our oil from our estates?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Take your hands off me animal!
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Are you going to graduate school?
Where is the car?
What?
But could you try?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Is anything wrong?
Was she married or something?
All right.
Okay.
I do.
Don't cry. 
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
What?
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Well, I want you to leave.
Let me go.
What are you going to do now?
When?
Carl who?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Yes, I will.
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Mrs. Robinson?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Give me an hour.
Can I help you, sir!
What?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Yes sir?
Will you take me home?
You don't?
Will you come in, please?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
All right then.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Thank you.
What are you so scared of?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
What?
Don't be nervous.
May I have a drink?
Do you want me to get it?
Why don't you get it.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- goodbye then --
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Will you bring me a hanger?
Thank you.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Oh.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
Him?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
What was your major?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I wish you'd tell me.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
This is absurd.
I don't believe you.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
They don't know?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
I guess -- about my future.
Why?
Have you thought about graduate school?
Say that again.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Thank you.
I know.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Hello.
Yes?
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
And what are you going to do?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Reducing?
Too bad.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
You were very different yesterday.
I'll do anything for you.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
And -- and --
Yes -- tired...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I want to be alone --
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Why do you smile?
And?
There.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
Do you understand?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
On the train?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
The Baron is tired?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
I've no luck.
I take five hundred.
It's always so quiet here.
The war.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Hello! Hello! --
For me?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Anyone asked for me?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Oh, I've got to find it.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
What...! --
Moreover...
Tired?
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
What?
Skiing? 
Cotton Company --
How nice -- your daughters?
Miss Flaemm.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
All right.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Sorry, Preysing. 
I can't dance tonight --
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Madam will dress now, it is late.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Hurry, Suzette.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
We will wait.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Hi, Bobo.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
You're a thousand percent right!
Right in front of the room.
Want a look?
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Yes, yes, but that's --
You are a valued customer, as you know.
All right.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Sounds like a good Idea.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Perk, remember?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
I tripped over a chair.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I just came back from Phoenix.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
For God's sake, Lilly!
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I didn't teach you that.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy? It this all we have?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Nobody does that single-o.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
He retired.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What is it? What's going on?
Roy Dillon?
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Yes.
Carter.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Why didn't you tell me?
What?  Where is she?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
What are you doing here?!
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
It's John, isn't it?
This kid just wants his freedom.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Who?
Keri, you all right?
What's this?
Better her than me.
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
No!!!
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
We've never met.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
You know what gets me?
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't tell you everything.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
What'll you do for transportation?
Could have happened to anybody.
Excuse me.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Me?
Okay.  Okay.
I know you think that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Blue soup.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Insurance!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Fifty years?
What went wrong?
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
You're my buddy.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Anybody home?
You were about to ask a question?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
Man and boy.
College!
Excellent!
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Dad?
Mom?
What's this?
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Eighteen--  and a half.
Some kind of animal?
How do you do?
Disease?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
I have some change!
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Which one?
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
What then?
And no one's there now?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Things.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
He's a child!
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
Honor, I suppose.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
You have chills?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
I thought she was a widow.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
With spittle?
Here.  Finish the job.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
What is this thing that kills me?
Don't shoot.
Thank you--for my life.
Leave the rifle here.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
No.
I know.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Where will you be?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Mom?
What does he say to do?
Everything stays as it is!
It's fine!
I hate that thing.
I see.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Is he all right?
The park!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
What was it?
What's the matter now?
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Or get eaten alive.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
No.
I just want to ask some questions.
What?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
I'm getting angry.
Is this all the display space we can get?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
Are you a private detective?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
No.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
Neither am I.
How important do you think sex is?
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
I can stop if you want.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Mast?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Where is she?
I don't know.
The police? They know less than you do.
Yeah, sure.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Where'd you hear that name?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
I don't know.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Not exactly...
I'm off that case. He fired me.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
You can fuck off, too.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
And what are you studying?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes.
How long have you been driving?
Your tree.
Okay, lady. Out.
Officer, I can explain.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
How interesting.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Sort of.
All right.
You don't look eighty.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Why do you say that?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
He's stopped.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
The ice is melting.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Look at the stars.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Yes.
Supper for two.
Farewell?
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
I feel giddy.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
"And this too shall pass away."
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
This is insane.
Would you like a cigarette?
Is Sunshine your real name?
Just give me a rough estimate.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
What would you say?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
I knew you'd come back.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
What?
What do you mean?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Who?
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
That's all for you, Sammy.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
What the hell was that? An ape?
Son. About Rasputin --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Yup.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Hey. You: think twice --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Anything else you --
Out? Out out?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Hit me.
Pardon?
Will you sign for the bed?
Oh.
No time for argument.
Many times.
We want the man who did this --
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Please listen to me --
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Oh my God.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Help me.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
So where's the harm?
Kirsty.
What happened?
Sure.
Kirsty? It's very late.
This afternoon.
All right.
What have you done?
Take it slowly.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be down in a minute
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
I suppose that's right.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No, not much.
First time for everything.
Why don't you do the same?
I'll get the doctor.
Who's there?
You'd like the house.
Of course. Every day.
Kirsty.
Yeah.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
PLEASE. You're in danger.
I won't be able to stand.
I'm here.
You know I do know the way home.
All right.  No. That's nice.
What do we do if there isn't?
I see.
If I make it through the day.
Steve. Thank God you came.
What did I say?
'Bye.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
What?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
None.  Christ!
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
Why not?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
What?
That's what I said.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Hey Charlie.
Huh?
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
I dunno.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Are you coming home?
Did you say something?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Is it better?
I don't know.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
When are you going back?
You know, with Ray...
C'mon.  I want to know.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Barry said its done.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
What are you going to talk to me about?
I know.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
About what?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Rob here.
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Is Ray going?
Enough, Liz.
Don't you like that?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Which way are you going?
Hi, Mom.
She left.  She's gone.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
How old is Richard?
I warned you.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Byzantine?
Someone beat you.
I have friends.
Jesus Christ.
Why not?
He tried to kill me last night.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
I'm not even sure why.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
What's wrong?
What is it?
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I want Taupin.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Aye.
I was driven out.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Does it change with me in the room?
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Aye.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Finish your prayers?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Don't threaten me, Private.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
How are you?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Run!
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
The resemblance is amazing.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Are you back?
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Too hot?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, I'll try to give her one.
How long would the interview take?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, she'll know some day.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
Get out!
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
What do you want?
Hello, Hildy!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Done what?
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
You've had a better offer, eh?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What do you think I am -- a crook?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
All the words you've got.
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Hello -- hello...
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Then why are you doing it?
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
It'll be Heaven!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Anything you want, Boss.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
I'll call.
We know what you're up to.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Just a minute, Johnson!
He's harmless.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
After all I've done for you --
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
A sight for sore eyes!
Who is this man?
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Who is it?
You fight it cut.
Have you got my dough?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Come on with that money!
Here!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
Mother!
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Hey --
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who? Me?
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Here's the picture of my wife.
Look out!
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
This is going too far, young man.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
It's true.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Do you know any swear words?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Sod.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
You wouldn't.
You're the biggest fibber.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Crocodiles! Aah!
But Dad, It's the News.
You said that last year, Dad.
Wow!
Who pays for them?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Has Sue got it right?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You know it? It must be an old one.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
You're having me on, Molly.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
You mean John Wayne?
But if you did.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Really fucking awesome.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Almost there.
Honk at him. Scare him.
What's he so excited about?
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Hey, he moved.
Check this out.
What are you doing!
And...
How's about you give me those same directions.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Why?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
A couple hours!
What'd we here, Georgie?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where is he?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Say my name.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Shall we close up, then?
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Fine.
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Yeah? What?
Well?
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
That's what I'm counting on.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
So?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Be still my crotch.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Done!
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'll be in touch.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
I'm sorry about my parents.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Who is it?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
It would just be helpful to know.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Bravo to you, Puff!
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Unn.
Puff, put the gun down.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Mother?
Yes.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I'm ready.
I want to talk to you.
Are you ready for another?
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Will you take a check, Bert?
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Sign up.
Thinking about what?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Fine.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
Sure.
I'll beat him the next game.
They're fine.
Tell her what?
Well, here it's half.
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
It's quiet.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
In the gut, I mean.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Go to hell.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
HOW MUCH?!
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
When?
That's right. When?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Hi.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Long wait for a bus?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Have a nice trip.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Do you want me to go?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
What is it, Eddie?
What do you want to tell me?
For how long?
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Very good shot.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Yes.
Do you still want me to stay?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
You and that damned garden.
So, what do you do?
You built things.
Bathroom?
Son ... are you awake?
Why, Dad?
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
Are you all right, Dad?
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
It was so real, Dad.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What's wrong, Ellen?
What did he talk to you about?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
Did you call the State Police?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
What do you want?
David? How'd you get this number?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
You still believe in him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
I don't know how you put up with him.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
There's good news and bad news.
Perfect, she's using it.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You punched the President in the face?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
This I can see.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
And our forces?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
That's impossible...
He's trying to impress you.
You can't go. Call them back.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You're late.
Really? Ballet?
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
Marcus!  I did it!
Your treat.
Marcus!
Henry, the pen --
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
An old man's dream.
You could be more right than you know.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
I'm through!
Doctor Jones?
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
It would make me very happy.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
Uh-huh.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No. You like the way I do things.
What do you know about this place?
Dad!
It's important!
No, Dad. You listen to me --
Found it.
Well, what was left of him.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
How did you she was a Nazi?
What?
Stop!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
My Diary's in Berlin.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Those people are trying to kill us!
What did you find, Junior?
Ready?
Get that camel out of the way!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
All right! Where's my father
And why were you trying to kill me?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Who?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You have insulted my son.
What you look at, Indy?
No, the stones are mine!
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
India...
What do you mean -- how?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
What?!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
He's afraid of something.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
What?!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
What?
Indy? Did you talk to them?
So now they believe me.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Figures...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
No, not her. Me.
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Do me a favor, Al.
My place, can't you see?
I told you, my name is Al.
Are you threatening me?
Are you crazy?
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
What was that?
I'll talk to them.
What's that?
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know...To get Al.
You are CRAZY!
What do you mean we.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
I don't like the sound of that.
Door's locked.
Corridor A.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
What is it?
What do we do?
...and a license to kill...
They'll know who I am.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Now what?
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Wait.
Where is she staying?
...Joe.
What happened?
Without your pants.
It worked.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Follow that busboy.
He recognises you, throw him off.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
It's him.
haka xuki.
He hung us up dry.
Holy...
Do something.
What happened?
Gimme a minute.
I have been... I think you're right.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
JOE What abilities...?
Sorry...
No!
I'm against it.
Nice?
You've cut your hair?
How about a deal?
Yes?
I don't want to intrude.
Al Viola.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
It may have been affected.
When you do...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
You'll feel better
Joe.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Don't do it!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
Is someone else here?
I can't do that?
And you?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
As if your mind's not all there.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
And how'm I doing?
Who do you work for?
Trans Ocean Travel.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Why?
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
Who did?
You don't believe me.
What's Gruner like?
And Dieter.
Where we going?
That must be him. Water taxi.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Why not?
What happened?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Riuji?
What is it?
Is there anything else?
Wait.
Could I have it, please.
Hi, honey.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Three hours.
Push it.
When's the air date?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
And what are you implying?
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Come again?
Hey, Lowell.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Right now?
Why? Who said?
What's going on?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
I got perspective.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
We're there.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Thank you for saying that...
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
That Canada story? Still interest you?
I know what I have to know.
How much would I get paid?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Hello. You there
What did you get us?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Good. But Jeff...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
What's changed?
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
Where are you, anyway?
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
What are you talking about?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Most certainly.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
What a touching story.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
You're in a rush.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Objection, your honor!
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
You're in check.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Is she Asian?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
My God.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
You like kids.
You're vulnerable.
Not yet.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Is that you?
Hmmm...
She never particularly cared for me.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Apparently she was very disappointed.
We're damaged goods.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Good.  Are those foods?
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I want to nail you ass.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
It's a no go, Joe.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Murder!
Are you alright? You lost weight.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Do you know him?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Every week --
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
So what?
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
My client has ruled that out.
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
And it's good!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Where does that leave us?
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Nothing?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Wrigley!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Oh—Mary—
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
I might.
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Please don't shout.
Ellie—
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
Peter Warne! 
Are you going to see him?
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
All right, let it go.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Oh, yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
Here—
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
King—King Westley was in it.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Yeah.
This isn't "piggy-back."
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Not a one.
This looks like the best spot.
Peter—
But what!
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Here comes a car!
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
You might give me a little credit.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
What'd you give him for the car?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
What about money?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Congratulations.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Yes—if he is your husband.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
I've been thinking about you.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What!
If it's on the level.
Who's she gonna marry?
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
What?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
A trumpet?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Not a minute!
Wife?
What's up?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Five G's—or I crab the works.
I can use a smart guy like you.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
You love them, don't you?
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Who?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Why?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
What do you mean?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I'm not sure I understand.
I wouldn't imagine where.
Please answer the question.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Hi.
My sympathies.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
Did they live?
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
They killed him, honey.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Goddamn Sam!
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
How much more?
You have other information?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Can I help you?
This looks pretty good on me.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Won't forget?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
What's she willing to give us?
We are. Don't worry about it.
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
My pocketbook.
Help us do what?
How was your flight?
I gave you my card there.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
He's the one who wants you.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
What, I couldn't hear you?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Who is this?
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
How do you get it out?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Does something else worry you?
Fifteen thousand.
Well, hello.
Catching a movie.
What're you, a bag lady?
You talk them into it?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
He was here?
You think he's got a thing for you?
He tries to act cool.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Where's the rest of it?
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
He's liable to shoot you.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
If I don't cooperate?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
We can look into that.
How can you help us?
I'm recording this.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
Uh-uh.
Jackie?
Are you getting that black suit?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
Beaumont Livingston.
What do you think it is?
What the hell you doin'?
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
I got a problem...
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
It's boring, isn't it?
Where at?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
So where did you go?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
As low as two.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Who was that?
Who was Beaumont?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
What'd you shoot her with?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
I'm going out for a few hours.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
How can I help you?
That's Winston. He works here.
Yeah.
What's his full name?
Getting there.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
Hey, Max.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
What's up with this shit.
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
That's all?
Well, give it to me then.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
All I did was walk out with it.
This place stinks.
She's all alone.
It's the next street.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
He's around.
Get me out of here.
Remember?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy!
You have an unusual hand.
You know, you got a strange line here.
Daddy, what was that noise?
There was a bang.
Wait ... Daddy.
Doctor.  Ph.D.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
I moved the couch. That's all.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Who? Jed?
And look what I got.
Wait. Don't.
What does it say?
What'd the doctor say?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
Remember that.
He said you didn't have one.
Who else were you expecting?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I want to know. You tell me!
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's going on?
WHO ARE YOU?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Why won't you answer me?
I don't know you.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Where's West? New Jersey?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
WHO ARE YOU?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
Please come quietly.
Push 'em back.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I don't know.
Can I help you?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
I have some ice from the machine.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Nice touch.
Better let me.
We're not supposed to do that.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Kay-Em!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Then what do we do?!
What the hell are you doing?
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
What's this?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Rizzo, you okay?
Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
Rizzo, pull away!
You okay?!
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Close the fucking door!
You're quicker than usual.
Jesus!
What are you doing?
No.
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Sorry, sorry.
Do I have to?
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kicker!
I gotta go back.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
More soldiers?
How do you open the damn door?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
What have you done?
Yes!
Can we get through these?
Just a favor for your old man.
Did you bring a check?
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
It's my charter. My party.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Probably out in the back yard.
Don't forget these.
Be careful.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
Only 24 hours!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
What? What?!
I hope we get some more help.
Would you like something? Some coffee?
You love sharks?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
Yep.
Well... is everything all right?
What have you got there, Lenny?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Over there!
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Coming right to us!
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Whose idea was it?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
We could get back together too.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know it's okay.
I try really hard, actually...
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
No.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
What? My eyes are not lying!
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Yeah.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
Junk?
Cold feet.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
What?
No.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
No...
Who is the kid?
What?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Dad, no!
Please stop now.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
What?!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
So. What's that thing?
What do you make with that?
Juno, what's the matter?
What did you do?
What?
Like what? Be a rock star?
A hotel?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, what're you doin'?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
That bad?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
So how's it going?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Carrie, watch for Early.
Any word from that gallery?
His Parole Officer.
Could be.
How old you?
With how many people?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Telly.
You got any money?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Man, this guy is really good.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Casper, where is he?
Casper! Was up kid?
Sup then? Sup?
Hey.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What is it?
Why?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Do you know where he went?
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Not too late.
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Yeah.
We seem to have a little problem here?
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Casual.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Morpheus.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
Then let's narrow it down.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You want me to what?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
What do you mean, stand out?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
We'll find the evidence.
Hello, Peter.
And -- what path is that?
Why not?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
But you said you didn't know her.
I'm just trying to play the game.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
How?
Have you any idea what the message is?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
Hello.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I know where you are.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
What scars?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Why did he?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You ready?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Anything?
What do you think he did?
I'm busy right now.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
He's right, Kathy.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
What have you come up with on the riddle?
As large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  It's posed as a question. What am I?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Then I'll transpose.
It's a good play, but risky.
You have something you want to say?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Sounds very violent.
You.
I think it's interesting.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know you didn't
Why?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
I just don't want to fight with you.
Did you call?
Peter, you have to admit--
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
We're almost married.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You have not slept in two days.
They know when they're going to die?
I cannot reach her.
Yes.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
From here, I must go alone.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
She can see the Beast!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
It is today?
Am I not worth returning to?
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
My <u>friend</u>.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Nothing worse than lower-class boors with upper-class morals.
Can't I come, too?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Food for crows.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He is the King.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It's a lie!
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Modred! Impossible!
It is the time.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Who speaks that name!
Do not try your trickery on me!
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
...You moved too, didn't you?
Why can't I have a bank account?
Take...
Rocket launcher.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Come on, get down!
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
Mathilda? May I come in?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
...I'm going to kiss you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Risky business, isn't it?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
...I had a girlfriend... A long time ago.  Before coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old... We flirted like kids...  Her father didn't want her to meet me.  My family was not very respectable.
May I ask you a personal question?
You say it just to calm me!
Don't fear.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
This smells good.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Nothing's going to happen.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I have to finish first.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
How long does this... Mania last?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Ellen?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
I know where my heaven is.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
That's a reasonable assumption.
What's his story?
Red flags man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Shit!  He jumped!
Well, hello.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Phileas Fogg?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Tom Joad?
Come on Mr. Parker.
In a hospital.
You're in pain.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
... My father.
Is it a boy or a girl?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
What do you want?
Coffee?
Water?
I guess I do too.
Do you want to fuck now?
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
Yes.
You OK?
Thank you. What time is it?
What do you mean?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Your color.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
What did they look like?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
What?
No.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
What are you talking about?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
I'm sorry, but --
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Why didn't you call me?
Uh -- both?
Yes?
After you went to all that trouble?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
You ready?
Good one.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Good luck.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
Why?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
The what?
What the hell is that for?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Neither.
And I fully support that.
I completely agree.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Well, yeah, but --
You look -- nice.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
Elle?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Your love.
Damn you!
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
You're a beast!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
Might we watch, too?
You come stealee tleasoo?
No... I... I need to rest.
It's bluebells!
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
By the grace of God.
Shhhh!
Pregnant, is she?
Track the demon to his lair.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Nice piece of work.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
What make ye of that, Jack?
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Wait, Jack.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Give in to despair and all is lost.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Can't we move any faster?
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
But you did... you did!
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
I have no wife.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
How do I get the horn back?
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Wondrously so.
How so?
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
I'm promised to another!
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
Hello, Jack.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
How came you by this blade?
Uhm... fine work.
Simple as that, eh?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
In a dream.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
And video games after!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
I put him to work.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Alyssa.
What's today?
Can you keep Sam straight?
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
Hey.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
I don't know.
You should stay.
Really?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Where are you?!
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Oh, yes.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
Right...she married...what was he?
Forty.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Sam?
I didn't recognize you!
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Because I live there.
I'm not going!
Probably in the bible.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
I don't beg.
Where are you going?
Where is it?
Hi, Alyssa.
What are you now?
That's not true.
Why wouldn't she leave?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
You look better than ever.
She seemed upset.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
And you told Mom today?
What kind of house?
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
I need to talk to you.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
I did say he could go.
Do you need help?
I'm married.
Are you going to kiss me?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
I wasn't sure.
What are you talking about?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I'm helping George build his house.
That's the problem.
Where are the kids?
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
You don't look like you.
Hey.
You could keep it and rent it out?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
I brought a few of my own.
Go tell your father we're eating.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Sharp.
Married?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Want me to come back some other time?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Can't you remember your own name?
What?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
What ain't there?
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
It's a pardon from the governor.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
Back to New York for starters.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
What'd you say?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
It's too late for plans.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
All in, boss!
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
What are you doing here, mama?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
No!
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Valerie's crying!
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
What is it?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Boogerland!
Look who's back from the dead.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
This don't look good.
Which way did he go?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
Adrian?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
That just hurt a lot.
You callin' me a thief, my man?
I'm a Sandman!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Where do you think we came from?
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
That's better.  How do you want us?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Why?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Did you ever see Francis-8?
You missed something special.
Who invited you?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Why aren't you in Nursery?
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
You prefer women?
And now?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Are you here to help me?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Will you take me with you?
What do you suppose this was...?
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
...But I still have the choice...?
We can't. We're going back.
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
What people?
Come with us.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
Are there any other humans?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Are you ready to put him in?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
I don't know who you are. I'd like to thank someone.
Well? How do you like it?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
You're not contagious are you?
Good... You up for a drive?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You want somethin'?
What's happenin'?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
I was here yesterday.
I don't know.
How'd it happen, Alice?
In pornos?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
You got him.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
I don't. I don't know him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sheila?
Please tell me.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Have you made any charges against him?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Who is it?
Yeah, Mack?
When he went to work, right.
Who is it?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I won't ever tailgate.
Something wrong?
We've met before, haven't we?
At your house. Don't you remember?
At your house.
Who's it from?
You're up early.
We will.
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
At sixty?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Hello.
No. No, I don't.
Sheila?!
I was?
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Uh-huh.
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
He might have lost his way.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
Certainly not.
What are we going to do?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
And mine's Conway.
And the wine - excellent.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Who?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
You're lying, aren't you?
Are you taking me?
It's astonishing - and incredible, but—
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
What is it? Has he fainted?
He's dead.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Let me up! Let me up!
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
Maria?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
You shot an eight year old girl.
The hell were you thinking?
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Helluva night, isn't it?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
We'll take it from here.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
in case I need it?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Wally!
The other two will die without me.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
And replace them with new ones.
You the sentry?
You the only sentry?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Lara called me.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
John --
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We can't grab it...
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
But you call this room the "temple".
She was looking right at me.
Wally, listen to me...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
You're not gonna kill me?
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I believe in that system...
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
You said they're destroyed.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
This is all my fault.
It's insanity around here.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Congratulations, sir.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
What?
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
He looks familiar.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
No.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Are you sure?
So, wait, you're from where?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Is he cute?
He's great, right. Is he great?
You're not my daddy.
Uncle Bobby?
Oh my god. What happened?
Oh, please.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I feel weird asking him.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Max offered to stake me.
Take her.
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
He making the drop?
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
When's it going down?
Where is this happening?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Brooklyn.
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
A bad heart.
What's the plan?
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
No. Just the cross streets.
Taken care of?
Any time, bro.
What about it?
So, it was a draw.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I'll page you with the number.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Nice work.
I don't know.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
I'll get the girl.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Motherfucker...
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the fuck was that about?
What are you doing.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
We need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You did?
So what do we do?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
You look good, man.
Yes?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
You strapped?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
See you later.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
And where is...?
Coke?
Here they are, then.
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Yeah.
I get it.
Don't worry. I get it.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Who's gonna outfit us?
The Red Dragon.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Why?
It hit?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Let Billie finish.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Man, what do you want?
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
I can't make out that shit.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I can't.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
We need you too!
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
I assumed...
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
What color were the original Hebrews?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
If you want to tell me.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
That's a fine chick.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
Yes sir.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[Why?]
[Senor?]
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Reina Rosas.]
[How does it work?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Drive.]
Who's he?
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
So how's business?
Yeah, right...
How long you staying, Crease?
You did something on impulse?
What are you doing here?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You mean a misfire?
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Where are you from, Creasy?
Potential? I don't understand.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Did you like school, Creasy?
Not at all?
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
Do you think he'll come back?
It hurts.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
You feel sorry for the husband?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Where's my mother?
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
He has to go, Samuel.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
You helped him get this job.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Hey, Herbie...
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
You want me to ride down with you?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Who you gonna call?
Are you kidding?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
No...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
You got an elevator in this house?
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
I'm stag.
What?
Are you kidding?
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Don't worry about it.
It's loaded with what?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I don't like her.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Miss you, Walt.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Wisconsin.
So long, Ho-Jon.
What?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Never heard of him.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
I was just asking...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
Gimme three.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I think I heard about that.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Radar!
What for?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Is he out?
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
The bastards outconned us.
But I'm married.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
No, never in the slightest.
How much time do I have?
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
About that chest-cutter...
First decent idea you've had in a month.
What's wrong with you?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Never mind.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
How is he?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Action?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Against anything. Just protest.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Did you write this?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
What?
Say that again.
What John Doe?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Hurry up, Pop.
Well, maybe you're right.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Baseball?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What do they want?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
St-rike!
Grubbel's here. See? 
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
How could he be a fake? 
A what?
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Four bits.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Sure.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
What's your name?
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's a lie!

Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Floor seats.
Who is it?
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
I won't get away with it.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Where's the car?
Hi, Roper.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Anything on Korda so far?
You don't have to come here.
For now that's all.
Satisfied?
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
How do you feel after a shooting.
Recruited you from where?
You don't like New York?
You'd never been out of New York?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
We see each other every couple of months.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
You know the ten commandments?
What's the first commandment?
Yes.
To save lives.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
To run last?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
You're crazy.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
McCall, you all right?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
I worship you.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
Yeah?
You crazy? With all those people around?
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Where's the damn wire?!
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
Repoed this morning.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
This is Halden.
What do you need?
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
What's happening?
It's time to wake up.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Take care.
He had access to the keys --
Try harder.
One condition.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Then how do you know about --
Why?
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Connect to public access.
We've got him locked!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
So how can we get to it?
Wow.  Sand.
Release the power with the power.
Anybody see anything?
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
... A falcon?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
I'm outta here.
GET OFF ME!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
THREE SECONDS!!
NINJA APE ZORD!
We're asking you to go to prison.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Something came up.
Have you thought about this?
You could have stopped him.
Charlie!
Who'll make the rules?
Meyer just finished the books.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Like Don Maranzano.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Come off it, Bugs.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I'm glad ya come.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Forget it. That's past.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Wanna know what I think?
Where's the stiff?
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
You're fuckin' crazy.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Who did this?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
What?
Monkeybone?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
DEATH!!
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Bitchin' good cake.
What are you watching?
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
What's the matter?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Who told you we deal drugs?
So, what do you think?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Where to?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
You've never *seen* this contract.
But it *isn't*?
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Drunks are funny--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Diz!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Otis!
Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or Henry Hill?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Oh--oh.
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
Jeff for Senator.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
A pet shop?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Where were you?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Well--goodnight.
Y-yes.
For a *question*.
Mr. President--
Mr. President--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Fine--
What is it?
*No*!
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Whose statue is that?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
A *day*!
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Good. Where are we?
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
You mean--here?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Ax?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
What! Who?
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
You want to see me, Senator?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
What do you want, Senator?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield?
Since he was born.
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
No. Are you?
Are these the articles?
Are they true!
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Sure. I met you.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
There's Times Square.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Here's a nice place.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Good night.
The guy's balmy.
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
How'd you get the picture?
When're you going to see him again?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
What're you going to do?
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Is that the best you've got?
You can't come up here!
We'll send for the police!
He's what?
It's a lie!
Hang up.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Where?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
No?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
We provide opera.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Naturally.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Well, I don't know. I—
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Brookfield just came in.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Who are they?
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Where is your farm?
What do you think you're doing?
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Please!
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
You're the shrink, aren't you?
What an asshole!
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
What's that?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
You're the doctor, what do you think?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
What?
How long you been in this town?
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
What'd you want?
No.
I've offended you!
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
...How violated I feel?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Amazing.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
A doll?
Damn! What is your name?
I've told you a lot of private stuff.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Psych major?
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
Yes... your particular approach.
You know where he's taking her?
Who the hell are these guys?
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Yeah?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
And what is he in prison for?
And what did he say?
Where are they taking him?
No?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Yes.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
That "thing" gets me excited.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No... Why?... Should I?
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I'm staying.
You...! YOU...!
Have you no respect for the dead?
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Juicy?
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
None taken.
Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
What?
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
It must have slipped my mind.
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Do I?
We could really use some coffee --
Atta, girl!
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
How about... the Savage Six?
Superheroes.
That boy's got talent.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
And the light goes out...
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Hi.
What's your real name?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Bye. 
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
You sure that's how you spell it?
I'll drive.
Cover me!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So why don't you just tell her!
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
Roy --
You guys going to a costume party?
Jeffrey!
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
You did?
Do we have to?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
That was too close.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Ah -- you approve?
I'm glad you like it.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
There are none here.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
You realize what is at stake?
And where is the army?
And who is defending Paris?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
General Bonaparte?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
My God...!  What time is it?
When did it start?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Thank you.
Thank you, Napoleon.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Ah, that is good.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Were any of them married?
She must have been in love with you.
Promise me you will never leave me.
Promise me.
Promise.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
And, where did you see my portrait?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
And where do you place Alexander?
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I know you smoke weed, right?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Great moves, Day-Day.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Me neither.
I ain't trying to rob you...
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Who is that?
This you?
Man, this a cool house.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Who is that?
You better stop running from that girl.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Blow.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
You see that?
How you know?  It could be anything.
You make it sound so easy.
You go first.
You're welcome, Unc.
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
You did all this for me?
Delivery!
That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
What it smell like?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You see that?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What is it?
Are they still out there?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
You wanna knock?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where did Craig move to?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
Need to lose some weight.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Elroy, what happen?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
'S okay. What do you think?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I have a problem.
You shot her?
Who did?
What?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Yes, yes, I understand.
You're out of your mind.
Again.
No.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
I think you better put that away.
I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Please...
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
You're going to go see her.
Well?
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Close your eyes.
Yeah.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Leavin', boy?
Uncle Birdie!
I'll light the lamp.
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Plan on a longer visit next time.
What's wrong, Mother?
Just went?
Is he hit pretty bad?
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Hing, hang, hung.
Why?
Where's Mom?
To see Dad?
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
I'm hungry, John.
John?
Are we goin' home, John?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What are you doing, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Now: Where?
Nothin'. 
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
John's bad.
About our secrets.
What's their names?
How's that?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Mornin', ladies.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What are you after them for?
I been bad!
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
The killer.
Bring him out of what?
What!?
You used me, daddy!
Decide to take a day off after all?
Dad -- what you doing here?
Who? Who did that?
Where you think you're going?
Get into bed.
What?
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
What's with the bars?
Give me the key, mother.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
What the hell you doing here?
No more fights?
When did you have a nightmare?
Thank you, Comrade.
Well, here are fifty francs.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Well, a hat...
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
A dress you wear in the evening.
Yes.
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Your Highness...
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
We don't want to be disturbed.
If you want to see us you must come later.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
A week?
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
What's new?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Give me another double brandy.
What can I do about it?
You want me to go in there?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
I must get into that country of yours!
You, please.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Thank you.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Is that customary?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
That is correct.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Room service speaking.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Because we are an odd couple.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
No speech.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Would that make you any happier?
No music.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
All right, I'll listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Now, please, Swana.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
You leave me no choice.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
How much do you need?
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
It's a code or something.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
I like it.  I like the idea.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
No, you didn't, Bob.
What about England?
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
About a dozen.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Just do what I say, Bob.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Mr. President!
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Mom expects great things from you ...
Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
I never thought Jack was ready for the presidency.  But I would never, never consider ...  His death was awful, an awful thing for this country.  Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Why, you got a customer?
Who we working for?
Howard ... What the hell?  What're you doing?
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
Proud?
Of them.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
I'll concede in the morning.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
You don't have to go.
Buddy? ...
Are you okay?
Because ... I have to relax.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
What?
You heard it?
How come're you doin that?
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Well what would you call him.
He's real all right.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Wasn't no bullet?
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Maybe I'll go ridin.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
You gave your word?
Not like that. Not like you say.
Did you buy that gun?
I need to know that.
Big talk.
Llewelyn.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
Llewelyn --
Mama's gonna raise hell.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
And where is that.
What's this about?
Huh? What is...
Mm-hm.
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
...I know where you are.
All right.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
This. And the gas.
Now. We close now.
...What time do you go to bed.
Yes I do.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
You already have the tent?
What kind of tent?
You on all night?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Okay.
What do you want to know?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
Could I get another room.
That's me.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Took me about three hours.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
...You didn't take the product, did you?
The heroin. You don't have it.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Don't jack with me.
How is she?
...I meant your food.
Sheriff, I don't...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Did you send anyone out there?
Junior year!
Great. Good. Content...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
That's my son! My son is dead!
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Oh, you mean Fred.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Lyla's very nice.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Why are you doing this to me?
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
Sure you don't want any salad?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
...well, then you ain't got much.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
How did you know?
What are you doing?
I got this apartment with a guy.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Does he know you think he's real?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Really. And where was that, old man?
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
What do you mean?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Now, that's really stupid.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
What?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I said 'got it?'
This is Betty at twelve.
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Isn't that the point?
Really?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
You lie, motherfucker...
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Waitaminute -
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Huh?!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
'N turned into a frog -
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
A miracle! It was a miracle!
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
What's his name again?
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Latch right on to that tit.
Devil his due.
Ass right.
Vernon Waldrip.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
It was a moment a weakness!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But...
Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
Okay, okay. You win.
Hi, Byron.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Great ass.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Joe!
When did this happen?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
See you in the fleet, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Something tells me you've been here before.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Sid, there's no baby.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
Lynette, where's Sid?
God help you, Lynette!
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I vote for the motel.
There's always a choice.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
You stayed after all.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
That was great.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'm looking for Sid.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Could you believe those girls!
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What?
No problem.
You're welcome.
There is not one thing funny here.
You should see the look on your face.
What?  What do you want me to do?
That's your problem.
Get the fuck away from me.
Fuck!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
They won't get hurt.
Asshole.
Where did you get this clown?
She said she did.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
You don't look so good.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Master bath.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
A what?
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
Makes me nervous.
No, Edgar Allen.
Fuck him.
Damn it!
I heard you.
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What, what, what is it?!
Morse code?
I'm sorry.
Why?
What if I spazz out?
No...
What are you doing with the gun?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Like?
So... we understand each other Judge?
Inspector Brimmer
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
I don't think that will be any problem...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Alone...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What's up with you?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Sorry man...
Motherfuckers...
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Rose?
Yeah.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Of course, I do.
You're surrendering.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Thank you.
That is a separate issue.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Is it?
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Don't go in there.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Where is he now?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Don't touch him.
It is ended.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
How many came back?
I was sorry to hear about your son.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Father, you can't let them take him...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Please hurry.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, sure.
I'm not tired!
Was it Pascow?
Nice.
I can hardly read these.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Going to tell Ellie?
But--
What say, Louis?
What do you mean?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
It's funny, all right.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Can I have another one?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
My God!
She's finally asleep.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Getting there.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You stole my boat.
That boat is my livelihood!
How does he do that?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
No, I really think I do.
Why don't I want to do this?
The situation has changed.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
You have a name, missy?
You've got sand, for a maid.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Difficult ... to say.
I know the code.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
To freedom.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
How did you get off the island?
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
What's your name?
We had time to get to know each other.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Move!
Why are brothering with that?
I'd die for her.
Come aboard.
This is either crazy, or brilliant.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
On what?
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
No, it's not.
He's still breathing.
What happened here?
Commodore --
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Pollution?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What are you going to do to him?
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no?  Smell this.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Icarus?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Is that what Argon told you?
You're afraid of him.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Yes?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
Susan!
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
You don't know?
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
Susan!
Look at this!
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
What's wrong?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
You made this out of my hair?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
You saved my life.
Susie... I...
What in the...?
Things do change.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
Icky!
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Exactly.
What do you want?
That's considerate of you.
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—!
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Oh hello, Anne– He types furiously.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Ah-ah-ah!
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
I knew your managing editor very well.
Yale '21, I believe.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
What do you want?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
It has been alleged - yes—
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
The boss is getting hoarse.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Thanks, thanks.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
How far have you gotten?
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
What do you know about Conrad?
What did he want?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
A statement? Good.
Hello, Smith.
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
Double-strength!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Did you call, sir?
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
That's puttering, sir.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Does it look okay?
Wait.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
No she's not.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
It's six-thirty ...
Don't! Just let go.
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
But it could happen.
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Did you do this?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
Dan! Arrest them!
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
What did you do?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Those are my friends.
No way.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
You have no right to do this.
They're happy like this.
How come I'm still in black and white?
You got the admissions letter.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
How?
What's going on?
Where are they?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Why would I do that?
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
What do you mean?
I had nothing to do with that.
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Do you have the lettuce?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Bud ...
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Really?
Oh, hi.
Aren't you a little early?
What's wrong?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
It's beautiful.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Hello.
Please don't.
...please, I just don't want it....
You just said very food.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Hey. What are you doing?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Hello, this is Back.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Really?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Not very late.
Yes.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Hello?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Are you telling me no?
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
What do you do with all this pudding?
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
Alright?
How long have you known her?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Is everything ok?
Oh that's great.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Hi.
Really?
Yeah.
For work.....
Yeah.
Are you ok?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
On my knife.
The police are on their way.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
What do you mean?
Who is this?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Good morning, Barry....
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Nothing.
Ok.
I know.
That's cool.
As soon as you want.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
What did you say?
So...did my brother call you?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
What on earth would that require?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
And --?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
How is the patient faring?
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
Here it is; the last chapter.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Did I frighten you?
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
"...your wife."
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
Good God, Marquise --
Doesn't that please you?
You're just scared.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
I see. And you are in California for what reason?
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
He lied to me
I want blood
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Nope.
Manolete?!
The great Spanish bullfighter
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Oh Christ...
Mank-
You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell.
Sorry to disappoint.
It doesn't have to be
How?
Why her?
The title?
Craig is one syllable
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
What have I done?
May I help you?
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Pardon?
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
For Christ's sake, shut up--
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
Oh God. . .
How 'bout a real drink?
He's Christ?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Yeah --
Go 'head.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
You want us to wait for you?
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
Jake...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
You're not interested in him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
That he's got a pretty face.
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
What'd you see?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Open the door, Vickie.
What are you doing?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
I said, let's go.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is the baby sitter.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Jewelry?
Did you ever own a saw?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Jefferies.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Read some good books.
Something wrong?
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
Her father loading up the shotgun?
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
What about this morning? Any developments?
A Federal offense.
Huh?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
Mrs. Thorwald?
I wonder.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Ten here.
Hello.
Who's Thorwald?
How's your leg?
And your stomach?
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What do you think?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
What doesn't?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Wasn't that close?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Steady Marlon!
Just him.
I like you, you know?
Go ahead.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Will you let him tell it!
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Except yourself!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
He depended on me.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
You sure?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
I was talking to Jim.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Is he there?
John Crawford?
Where did you get the gun?
Boy!
You scared?
He has a knife.
Are you really going to meet them?
It's me!
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Hey where'd you go?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Plato?
Here.
Plato!
What?
How!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
No.
He called me chicken.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
No--I was just--maybe--
You still pretty upset?
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I'm getting that way, too.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You can trust me, Judy.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Plato, where's your father now?
Do you think your father means that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Good evening.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
You promised me!
He wants... your "sister"...
-- till he fucked his parole --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
No!
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
No --
Put him in the truck.
So you could get with my sister.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
You knew the place --
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What the fuck are you talking about.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
You do.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Get in the CAR!
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
Cancer-sucker.
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Ash... Ashley...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Switch seats with me.
Without having them hit the alarms.
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
I take it this is the bastard you told me about.  Why the hell are you beating on him?
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
You gonna put it away?
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I know.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
What happened?
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Gun shot.
No real people?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Anybody hurt?
And this is Helen Carter.
You can't leave us here.
Our kind of women?
What's the matter with her?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
They're stragglin'.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
All my clothes --
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Where you going?
I found their surrey --
I -- lost something.
That's right.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
At the ranch maybe?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
How's that?
You'll live.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I can't take her with me.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
That sure smells good.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
What's the matter -- restless?
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
How far up the trail?
I said let's go.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Would you like to learn them?
Aren't we stayin'?
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
What do they look like?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Well, Steve?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Are you okay?
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Thanks.
Ouch!!
It's coming!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Hello Brenda.
Hey, you left your book back there.
I meant you're into ghosts.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Buddy...
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, let me...
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Are you okay?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
How about these buns?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Stop! --
Noooo!!!
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
What are we gonna do?
Father!
Yes, we made it!
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Aww, the little bird died.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
I got it!
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
My God! Is she dead?
Professor, I think you should see this.
Professor, we need to talk.
Hello Dwight.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Father.
Father, are you okay?
Father, I think you should rest.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
0h, shit!
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
Bring her home... I guess.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
CHIP!!
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Detectives, what is this about?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
No woman would!
Goodnight, honey.
I love that you're my wife.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Who is this?
So you do drink?
Who wants fruit salad?
And who may I ask is Carl?
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Are we leaving?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
What is it, Betty?
You know who I am, August?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
I don't like this.
You scared?
Let's get out of here.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
Why, Mary --
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
She's a pretty good sort.
What did she want to know?
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
 What have you done about Irving August?
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
Could you find him?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
And you knew he'd be here.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
And you believe that?
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
What was she to you?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
And this poetry —— like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Ann?
Have you ever been on television?
Oh, uh-huh.
Well...
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Why is that?
My therapist said that --
So you don't believe in therapy?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
About sex?
What about sex?
Like what?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
Tell me your name.
Yes.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Yes, I have. I will.
Can't.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
No, you're not.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
But that was part of it?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Because.
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
Come on!!
I want to know why you are the way you are!
John?
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
No, I didn't.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Do you want to leave therapy?
Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
No, it's nothing like that.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
He just asked me questions.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
He wouldn't do that.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Why?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
It's a sun dress.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
The extrovert.
I just want to know why you're here.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Would anybody else see the tape?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
What did he say?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I would.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I've got to get back to the office.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Do you want me to stop calling?
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Mr. Millaney?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Hi.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
Jesus!
Kiss, kiss?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
But where are you going?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
BREAKING OUT
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
When do I get to see Brad?
SPONSOR!!!
We're the experts.
In a way...
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
I'd forgotten.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
. . .For his own good.
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
Our speciality.
Our field.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Bye.
Miles.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
I can explain.
Hiya.
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
Anything I'd know?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Just tell me.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
That's what you do with every one.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Have you no shame?
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
What do you think?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
So what should I wear?
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Been checking your messages?
Huh.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
With Maya.
We're on.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Well?
That's thoughtful.
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Me?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Come on, let me drive.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Nice. Very nice.
I'm having the salmon.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
So what's your novel about?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Okay. See you around.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Hello?
That was big of him.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Should we get dessert?
There's dust in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I'm scared.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
I cursed.
That roof is over ten feet high.
It's noise.
Do you think it's a possibility?
How can you say that?
Do you feel comforted?
Chicken Teriyaki.
They're on the roof.
We won't be able to get out of there.
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
It's getting stronger.
No.
That's good enough for me.
We might lose the signal.
What about Isabelle?
I can't even imagine.
Is anything missing?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Emmett.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
South of here, past Chimayo.
I gotta be going.
They got a saloon there?
Daddy?
Where is Rae?
That's a lie.
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Where's your brother?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
What are you talking about?
You can't do this.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Now let's talk about you chaps.
Hello, Rae.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why come to me?
What makes you think I could?
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I've given that up.
You've got a legitimate job.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
And I know what I'm talking about.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
Where's the dog now?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
The public decides who's on that list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
You're not renewing my contract.
Where is she?
I can't wait to meet her.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
She doesn't want pity.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
I just read somewhere --
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Where are you?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
What I do to Simone?
Simone?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
No, I'm okay.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
There's... a wall between you --
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
You have to see her.
Not like this --
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Me too.
How?
One thing bothered me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Do I know you?
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Nice boat, Taransky.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Good morning, Simone.
A star is...
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Wow. They called you their son.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
I forgot your name.
No.
No.
I'm going to see you again, right?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
I didn't know you were funny.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
...No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Yes?
I told you what I want.
I have to.
--What?
Don't cry.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Communicate?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Hi.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Curt Cobain.
Should we be doing this, dude?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
How... was she "called?"
Shit!
Is that right?
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
What about Jeremiah?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
Getting ready.
Wait a minute --
Suzie... No.
No --
Get out of here.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
Someone better tell Mac.
Shit.
How are you going to find him?
Sorry.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
Where are you?!
He's a fucking Martian?!
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Meat.
Welcome home.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
I loved you. I loved --
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Praise Jesus.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Is this fun?
What the hell's going on?
Well?
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Hey...
What the hell are you doing?!?
You know this guy, don't you?
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
An unmarked police car.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What kind of a guy is he?
Why are you stopping?
One to five?
He's just exhausted.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Why should I?
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
How long's this gonna take?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Bandit?
Loud and clear.
You know how to drive one of these things?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Bandit II?
You're coming up to the scale house.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
Breaker. Breaker.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
What about the sheriff's task force?
Maroon uniforms?
How bad?
No.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
And this is your car, isn't it?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
His law firm, same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
So I guess you're not going.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
What'd you say?
...I'm sorry...
FUCK YOU!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
You got clicks, anything?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
I'm working on it.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
What were you doin' here anyway?
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
What else did Padiche say?
Gibarian.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
Listen --
You murdered her!
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
Is there anybody else here?
How much sleep do you need?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Kelvin, you awake?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
They come when you sleep.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What do you want?
When did this happen?
Not a very happy poem.
Is it intelligent?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
I like that too.
What are you talking about?
But we fought.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
What's wrong?
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris --
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
How can you be here...
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Straight ahead.
What did he say?
Are you nervous?
Would you pick one out, please?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
What about Neil?
I do care about you!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
What a memory.
How long you going away for?
... Mike.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Tommy...!
Mike?
For how long?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What did you watch?
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
What about when she goes out?
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
You in this with me?
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
You should'a brought the girl.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Under the table.
What're we having?
You coming in?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
Lizzy!
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
What's this? A cockaroach?
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
Good morning, Liz.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
My my.
You should write that one down.
Some prep school thing.
Well, no.
You'd feel what?
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I'm a photographer, remember?
Poison emergency.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
You're sure you're all right.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Jawohl!
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
There's only one pair left.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
You make my mouth water.
How did he get over there?
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
105-353.
It is.
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Jawohl?
Jawohl!
Let me go! Let me go!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
No, Animal.
What do those broads say?
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Betty! Betty!
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Anybody call?
You heard that, Sefton?
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
Who did?
What are we going to do with him?
You could use a new one yourself.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
We have no radio.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
This is me in Cincinnati.
That is my wife.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
Have a nice time over there?
Where is he now?
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
This is its current position.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Is she still angry?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Well?
Really? What do you feel?
What?
Data, are you all right?
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
Can you locate them?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
Antonia?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Oh
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
Tractor beam, aye!
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Calm yourself, Bones.
Still no response, sir.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
How many more?
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
Count on our help, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Will you be able to handle that...?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Wait! Give me a chance --
Genesis, I want it.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
What I have done, I had to do.
So!  Speak!
Share this with no one.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
You're not going in there -- !
Uh -- what are they?
Shore leave, Admiral.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
You did this -- in a day?!
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
Jim --
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
We encoded four minutes --
I don't mean to intrude.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
They're still running with shields down.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Just barely, sir.
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
<u>WHY</u>?
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Is the word given?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
Carol Marcus --
They knew just where to hit us.
Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Affirmative, Admiral.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Admiral?
That was close --
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
May I remind the Captain that if a Starship enters the zone --
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
He's very human.
I do not understand the final question...
To Earth. To offer testimony.
I do this because I was there,
Heard there was some excitement.
How're you doing?
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
That's crazy!
An experimental device, doctor.
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can you isolate the wave?
Damage report!
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
"Neutralized?" How?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Iowa.
Then --
Do you trust me?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
So. There we are.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
You tricked me.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Mr. Spock, your computations?
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
There is a 20th Century possibility.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Spock...
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Warp two... three...
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Systems report.  Communications?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
I am well, Admiral.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
A perfect moment?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Don't you ever get tired?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
You either need a new uniform or a new neck.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Will he live?
Hello, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
Implants bothering you?
Full impulse.
Will that stop the tear?
What's inside that nebula cluster?
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Come in.  Hi.
Augh.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Montana.  Energize.
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
It's Cochrane.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
You actually performed surgery...?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Yes...
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
I have helm control.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
Who are you?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
This must be it.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
Ready to make a little history?
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Captain --
No... the door's too thick.
What's still there?
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Their com system must still be down.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
What?
Friends from Cornell...
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Port battery, ready sir!
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Report.
Good luck, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Report!
Report.
Wil... Data was down there.
Mr. President.
Figures.
Specifically of...?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Would you care to go topside?
My God, what happened here?
WHAT HAPPENED?
He's a DOCTOR!
Are those your words?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Just the size of my head -
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
Course heading, Captain?
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Isn't it about time you became something else?
What took you so long?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Sorry -
Surely not.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
WE volunteered?
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
What is it?
Spock, I'm really tired...
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
But I am not human. I am only -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
How did you - ?
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
NO WAY!
That could take hours!
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Do you know who I am?
Do you know where you are?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Why?
I do not understand.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
A weapon.
Yes, sir.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Why?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
Counselor.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
You're not here.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.

It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Sir --
It's working.
Report.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
What are you doing?
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Yes.
That's your life... not mine.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
My God...
This is a mistake.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
And?
Benny, God, take it easy...
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
George... Do you hear me, George?
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
What?!
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Go.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
I am husband?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
No.
What's the matter?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
But I must go here.
The driver will...
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
What happened?
The captain...
What are you doing?
Yes.
I like this music.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
You liked my singing?
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Good morning.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
What will you say about us?
There.
I love you.
Slow down, slow down.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Is it for real?
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
To the same woman?
Is there a reward in this?
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
What's going on?
No.
That's not sayin' much.
Naw.  She won't call me.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Looks like she was holding out.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
How did you hook up with Faith?
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Nero.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
What's his name?
That would be no.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
And gives it to you.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
No more, Lenny.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
What is it?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Got your ticket?
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
What is that?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
What does the Manager say?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Hi there.
You heard?
You... surprised me.
What?
Excuse me?
I've been looking for you.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
You have the photo from the diner?
We have another one.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
How do you feel, Agent
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
I'll take it into consideration.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Why did you go to Chicago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
There was talk of a file photo.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
You are so fucked up.
None taken.
You work with Koessler?
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
He thinks he looks young.
I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
I've been thinking about this.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Hello?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
You were right. He found me.
It's quite advanced.
All the same killer?
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Jaime --
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Suspect Zero?
I don't carry it with me.
[Reality very risky.]
Let's talk about Zero.
I want to go live with you.
Yes, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
No.
"MyDick?"
I don't...
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
You have to put things in perspective.
You've been through worse.
Are you calling Her?
How are you ladies doing this evening?
I'm sorry?
I'm Mike.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
You too?
I thought I was going to die.
To do what?
Anything?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
What do you guys do?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
You're a comedian?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
It's not going to well?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Well, I should be getting...
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Which one...?
Lorraine?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know, us.
I miss you, Mike.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So I don't call either way.
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Well that sucks.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
There are so many beautiful women here.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
I'm such an asshole.
They turned you down?
You miss the pain?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
It's kinda money, actually.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Mike?
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Are you ready to order?
Hello?
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
We're going to Vegas.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
They're all skanks.
Always, baby.
Always.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
She likes you.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Whatever.
Oh... a Dorothy.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
I gotta use the phone.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
Yeah, a good friend.
He drives a carriage.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
No.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
...the Copa, in New York...
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
Which one?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
What the fuck..?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...shivering...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Anaheim...
...Sue...
The bear's got his claws back.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
Godfather.
Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...
Godfather!
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
You look terrif on the floor!
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
And this?
What miracles you do for strangers.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Who are those girls?
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Is the hospital covered?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Was there a definite proposal?
We should hear what they have to say.
Jesus, I don't know...
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
What will your father say?
Can you say it?
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
When will I see you again?
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Tell me!
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
How can you be sure?
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
How do you do.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
You'd say if you mind?
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
It's just an undercoat. 
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I have to go to Venice.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I know. I write like a child.
I didn't mean with you in it.
What does he say?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
He's downstairs.
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Ha.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
You love me and you're not marrying me.
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
What about Christmas?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Tom.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I never said that!
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
What?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Look at me what?
Tom?
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I told you! I knew it!
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Let's go.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Will we see you later?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
Are you okay?
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Absolutely.
Nah, this'll be fine.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
What kind of people?
Really?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Try holding the match like this.
This I gotta see.
He's Black, OK?
No, I'm serious, really...
That's fine.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
What's your real name?
Don't you want to go?
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
God, you are square.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
How?
You're not much with girls, are you?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
What do you mean?
There must be something...
I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes.
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
Got your license?
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
So whatja do now?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Get it.
Travis.
Yeah.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Stick with Carla.
Spit it out.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Motor oil?
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
Surprise, surprise.
God's speed.
Hi.
What about you, Delly?
You've got everything?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
How'd it go?
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Whoa.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
I see...
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
No.  But...
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Did I what?
A few.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
You should watch what you say.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
Cigarette?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Sit.  Play with me.
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
That you got let go.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Will you help me, Sandy?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Yes?
Cathy?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Thank you.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then what was it?
I don't understand.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Miss Daniels?
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Where does he live?
And the white house?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Of course.
Daniels.
The little girl's name.
Thank you.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Young woman cut herself.
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Tell him about the party.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Where will we go?
Mother, get a rope!
They're gone. The same pattern.
We won't be here.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
No.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Does this room look silly?
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
Sixty...  Oh.
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
No, of course not.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
What did you say?
I don't know you.
How?
I think you're a louse.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
You like me, huh?
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Why did he shoot her?
What?
You were lying.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
I do different things on different days.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It smelled of the fire.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What it was, probably...
What do you mean?
Melanie, Melanie...
No, no...
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while.  Will you be all right here?
The town looks clear.
Where are they heading?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes, certainly. 
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
I don't know why.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How do you plan to do that?
We need them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You must leave this house.
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
But this woman -- and her son --
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
See that, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Where shall we put it? In the back?
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Toddy hates me.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
Can anyone hear what we say?
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
Was that it? Well, ok.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Two down. Two to go.
Think maybe knives do?
You killed her. I saw it.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
What did they give you?
What did they give you?
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
Fucking crow.
An accident, Nathan.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
What's with your friend there?
Look, can I just call a cab?
What is it?
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Such power exists?
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
He gave these to you?
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
I thought that was only for bombs.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Did all these people die in wars?
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
We certainly did.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
You must have come a long way.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
Hello--
I will be in just a minute.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I wonder if we ought to--
How do you know?
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Everyone seems so-- 
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Just twelve.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
Why not?
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
All together?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
They're looking at us.
Death to all vampires!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
What is this, David?
With him?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Leave him alone.
You can't kill me, Star.
Or a vampire.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
He's not glowing.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Are we havin' fun or what?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
It was a dream, Star.
Still mad at me?
Michael, are you still in bed?
Sure.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Ocean air!
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Lights out, Sam.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I'm really sorry, Max.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
What's your name?
When?
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Why not?
I know, I've felt it...
Huh?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
Mom's home?...
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Maybe dinner.
Where these tracks headed?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
What you doin'?
What?
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Let's open it.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Torch it over there!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
What are you doing?
I think so.
I guess you're okay.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Looks good.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Somebody definitely messed with it.
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
This storm do that?
Get your gear on.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
Yeah!
Now how did you get hurt?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
You know of them?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
What's it all for?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
This has to end.
Vox --
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
Why would you let me go back?
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm tired of running.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
You're late.
All right, what is it now?
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex, what is it?
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
I was not.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Yes.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
All of you?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Might I ask why?
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I am the oldest.
My father has gone to a better place.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
How did you get hurt?
No, you're safe --
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
But... what about Starks?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
And what's that?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
But I like it I guess.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
Do you really believe me?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
You're sure?
They're not here.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
What case?
How'd he get it?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
What do you mean?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
The future doesn't look different?
Who...who kills me?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
What were you talking about the other day?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
You ever been to jail?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
Have a good day at work today.
You want anything special for dinner?
Honey?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Who do you think did it?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
I've been better.
Alright.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Good God.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Oh shit.
Stop.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
What?
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
What happened to your hair?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
It won't work.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Idaho?
Whaddo we do?
Like a Chihuahua?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
What?
You do?
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
What'd I say again?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
You know what's happened, don't you?
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
Louise!
You're a good friend.
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Where you goin'?
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
No harm, no foul?
Gay? He said you were gay?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Well why don't you look her up?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
You know, clean the pipes.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Who?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Very nice.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
The sawbones?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
Are you... an architect?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Fine. Fine.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
How about -- ?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
So...
Mary ah, forget it.
Fuck!!
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
I don't buy it.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
I think your life's about to change.
Nope. Never been.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
What are you doing?
Miami?
Jai alai?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
You know, I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Friend. Baseball bat.
How many is that?
You little fuck.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
I'd go with the seven.
What's he like?
What's a mook?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up, Doc?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I think you'd better sit down.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Sure.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Well... why don't you move back?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Get out.
Ted...?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
It.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Starshells.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
That is correct.
John. How much time?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
What's that?
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Yeah.
What's this about?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Were you in Nam?
I did.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Maisy Blue Legs place?
I got one up on ya.
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What'd she say?
Alright. Alright...
Jesus, you alright?
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Ray...
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
What's he smoke in that?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Not no more.
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
This Clear Moon's house?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You take care.
This Jimmy's?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
What?
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Yeah, most likely.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
You saw a MiG 21?
Yes, ma'am.
What would?
There you go with those moves again.
Yes. I'll give you that!
How about what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Let's make it at eight.
You're horrible
You ever think about killing another human being?
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Just good luck.
...they say you're alright.
I want it back.
What do you do when you come here?
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
What does it mean?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Tomcats?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Yes, Sergeant?
Can't shake him.
Ohhh Mother!
I've got it -- hold on!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
No! Not again!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Let me do the talking.
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
Who is the best.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Helping him in.
You didn't help.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
What's wrong with this one?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Stop fighting and get out.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Your sexual orientation?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
You open it.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
What, aliens?
You're Kuato, right?
Yeah.
Why not?
What trip?
Where?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Would you please repeat the destination?
Is that better?
Who?
Who is she?
And you believe him?
Well...What do you say?
What are you doing?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I love you.
Secret agent...How much is that?
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I said get out!
So you dropped by to apologize?
Like what?
I don't need Kuato for that.
He's lying.
Where are you going?!
What reactor?!
What's wrong?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
You're really leaving, huh?
You didn't cook breakfast?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Jeez, look at that guy.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
You go north, I'll go south.
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
The con...!  Oh my God.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
It worked!  There they go!
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
"We"?
You can't remember that -- !
How can you remember that?
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
What other case?
-- Easy as that, huh?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
Let's get a cab.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Figures.
I killed the motherfucker.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
Afraid of what?
What went down?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
No.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Edward T. Dowd.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I don't think I know that name.
You getting this?
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
Five years.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
You're a l-lawyer?  I... I haven't had my meds, or m-my vital signs t-taken yet. I...
CIA?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
I'm nearly out.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
We can do it right here.
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Is there a golf course around here?
HE'S GONE.
That would indicate that it's the future.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
I see. He does talk loud.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
You want a muffin?
Where are you going?
Where are the Cookies?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Laura, I am your friend.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
You missed somethin', Ed.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Why? It does.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
Bobby killed a guy.
No.
You're getting warmer.
Josie, I think we should go public.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I hate asparagus.
Let me see.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
I always thought you knew it was me.
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Yes.
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
You would not...?
I do. Yes.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Objection!
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Thank you.
Kathy Price...
What did she say?
What is it?
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
I object, your Honor...
Why?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Do you think it's my fault?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
This is Miss Costello...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
Dr. Gruber.
Another, Frank...?
Well, well, well. Huh?
...now who is that...?
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hey, how about that!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
What was it like?
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
No, you don't.
What if it isn't over?
Guess so.
Like Freddy.
Diabetes?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
DO you mind...
no.
You going away?
Someone's coming.
This is going to give you nightmares.
In my bed.
Why does God let there be bad things?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
In what, a romantic comedy?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
When do you think it'll be done?
You're not crazy, by the way.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Really?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
Holy...
I know how Chase really died.
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
I want to see the body.
Studio B.
The car's no there yet?
Heather, what is it?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Captured?  How?
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Then what is he doing?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
But your instinct was to lose sail?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
She isn't that old.
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Yeah.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
He does.
Hey, shut up will ya?
You only hurt yourself you know?
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
Do you have your ticket?
Jesus.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
So... What happened?
It was so real...
It works?
That's how he died you know.
You all right?
Well, spit it out.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Oh, really?
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Immortality.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
What do you think?
We've got a problem.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
No, sir.
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
Easy for you to say.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Need a hand?
No.
No.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What is it?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
No shit?!?! You know him?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Gas?
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Hasta siempre.
What?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What's that honey?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Who do?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You ready for this?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
You been drinkin', huh?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
He's the kind liked it.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
I knew you'd want it again...
Have it your way... But you want it.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Get rid of him?
You need to explain it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Through the forehead?
Where we goin'?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
He's fine. He's narrating.
You all right, Professor Tripp?
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
Thank you.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Trip??
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
Is that just beer?
Shit.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
How bad is it for you?
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
So modest.
Crabtree.
Who do you think it is?
So -- what do we do now?
Want some help with that?
Such as.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
You driving this car?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Is that in my chart?
Better luck next time.
Who's got a gun?
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Really? That's remarkable.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
Is that really it?
The one she wore on her wedding day?
They're glass. The buttons.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
The guy on the phone.
Yes.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Colon cancer.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Kinship. And what's here?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
I'm not going, with them.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
I'm a little worried, James.
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
Hey.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Someone stole my car.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
And what did you say?
I lost it all.
I know.
Did you tell Walter?
The more the merrier.
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
No.
Is it good?
Who's that guy?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Five years.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
Then what? What?!
It's not what you think.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Carlos, can I ask you something?
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Try.
I'd love to hear it.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
I think you do.
I haven't broken any laws.
It's not for sale.
You walked home.
Do you believe in them?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You knew her?
I'd say you're moving.
But you are taking it?
Have you seen Walter?
People have the right to know.
No.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
What's her name?
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
I don't understand.
That's right.
Try it.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
How old are you and your sister?
But roughly, how old?
What the hell are you doing there?
I'm only asking questions.
What?
I'm talking about you.
What's weird about that?
You're quiet at work.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Are you?
Is that a school?
What about bears?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
So, what did you do?
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Depraved? My mistake.
I've changed.
Being here, with me.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
You're scared.
We should live together.
I've got problems.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
I don't need a plant.
Don't be scared, Walter.
I didn't sleep well.
I heard they were filthy birds.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
How you guys doing?
Lord Almighty.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hello, Brigman.
Virgil?
What's the matter with you?
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
But how could you say such a thing?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Well?
Have you decided?
How wonderful!
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Shall we go for a swim?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Are you feeling better?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Yes, you should go.
Oh, Sandro...
Claudia, listen to me...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Does it please you to say such things?
Then why do you say them?
Why are you looking at me like that?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
Good night, my love.
I love you.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
It's divine!
Do you consider that a compliment?
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Please, you come too...
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
What happened?
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
We have a radio like this, too.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Thank you.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
Your mother?
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Yes.
It's a sin to be fat.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
No I don't... the host is enough.
I'm being punished.
I don't know.
I just heard you.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Well, who in particular?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
He's told you?
Where do you meet?
Something I ate.
I went to my room.
Don't you know?
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
Where do you think babies come from?
Do you know a Marie?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
What the child?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Agnes...
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
You can tell me.
Yes?
Yes?
Why?
How does she know that?
Agnes, you're stupid.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Hm hmm.
What is it?
Who?
A crucifix.
No.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Agnes, can you hear me?
No...
I hate him...
Look into the convent records.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Larry...
Thanks. 
Martha, it's you.
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Yes.
No.
Do you still go to church?
Is that normal?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
This was before her pregnancy?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
What?
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Visitors to the convent.
There's nothing here.
Your niece!
Like keeping her home from school?
Listening to angels?
Because I am a moral person.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
I'd like to begin.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Did you know she was pregnant?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
For what?  An abortion?
The baby?
Before or after you killed the child?
I doubt that's what she'd say.
She can't remember.
Of course, John.
The usual ten per cent?
Lay them down.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
Why aren't you at work?
Can you fix him for me?
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
Sure.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Me? Why?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Sure. .
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Oh, there you are!
Sorry.
Oh!
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Gear?
Aye, I knew you were.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are they saying?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Anything to spare?
No, that's his other one.
Is that yours?
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
What's old got to do with it?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Hi Norm!
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
My eyes are lighter.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
He's been gone a long time.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Oh... God... am I cold...
Locked.
Are you in pain?
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Can we come up?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Are you okay in there?
Breathe deeply.
A transmission?
Yes!
Hello, Faust!
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Dead!
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Hey, guess what?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Hey now, what is this?
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Yes.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
What?  What was that?
What do you mean, no?
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
First contact...
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
What's wrong?
It's close, real close.
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
This looks ancient.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Oh God, oh God no.
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
They're on the next level up.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Where are we?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Oh my God.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Martin?
Find anything we missed?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Where did the parasites come from?
Take us up.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
What's it doing, having a seizure?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Two down, four to go.
Which presumably means...
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Let's get back and call this in.
Minh...
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Seal everything now!
I found it...
When?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
Hold it, hold it...
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
They knocked out the external feeds.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
Think I spoke too soon...
Do you believe him?
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
So, what do you think?
That's the wrong way!
And what is your name?
It needn't be.
You take charge.
Just like that, eh?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Just like it.
Aren't you?
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
You sat and talked until it was light...
What have you got to do with it?
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
She was a liar, she was a liar!
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
I don't think I'm going.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
She was magnificent.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
Macbeth.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Take care of yourself out there...
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
She did...?
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Need any help?
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Thank you.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
The audition.
Addison-!
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, I am.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
Just wondered what?
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
What have I got to do with it?
You think?
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Birdie-
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Not at all.
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
He can help you.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
She knows enough not to be here.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
What - again?
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Hi.  Hello, darling-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Not to you. Not to Bill.
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization...  ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
I remember.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Eve.
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
I'm glad Bill's back.
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Who's left out there?
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
I don't think I could be.
Hello..
Call, what call?
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
I said I'm a dying man!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
That was fun.  What now?
What's that?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Who'd you vote for?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
What's the matter?
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
You overslept?
--jeeeeeeesus--
I'll never get out of here in time.
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
Speak.
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
I think.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
You've really got to go.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
So tell me about the Times article.
No games, Irwin; give.
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Just tell me his title.
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Go on.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
How grand?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
Anything?
Howard--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--no--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
--which Young?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Hi. I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post and I hate to bother you at home--
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
All right, I got some scotch.
Of course, Finch.  What?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Come on!  I won't tell.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Nice car.
You don't like it?
What?!
Hi...
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You're missing the game for us?!
He likes it.
No.
No comment.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
You can send me the address too.
Did I miss anything?!
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
Okay.
Dad!  I know!
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yes.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Dad!!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Whatever you want.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Yeah, bring it on!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
I still think you're okay.
What's up, fellas?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
No...you...go...ahead.
Jim...
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Let me know.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Hey...
About the other day...I've been thinking.
You comfortable?
You sure you're comfortable?
Yeah Vick?
What?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Say that again, Kevin?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Then she said -- she loves me.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Okay, explain.
Kevin, it was just a --
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Bullshit.  From where?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
I think you need your balls reattached.
Merde! Just missed!
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Andy! Holy shit!
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Serafine...
What makes you so sure this will work?
They're coming!
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
We don't both have to die.
I know where he'll go.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Oh God. Shit...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Nothing's happening!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Psychic awareness. Right.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Now!
Merde.
Here.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Are you running away?
Noooo....
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Did I tell you that?
You'll laugh.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Why does everyone have to act that way?
Trust me, it's her!
I'm getting a chest cold..
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
Hurry up with those papers.
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
The "Odessa Dunk"?
You are the boy ...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
I did no such thing!
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Alvy, I...
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Oh, right.
Huh?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Fifteen years?
Neat?
God bless.
Oh, thank you.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Really, do you think so, really?
We can digest our-
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Don't you think I do?
Yeah, I know it's small.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, you have my body.
Were you always funny?
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
-me, my God, it's a great day!
yes, we had, uh...
That's sick!
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Christ!
Yeah, this place is great.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
God.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
You look very pretty.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
This is my room.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Oh.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
You all right?
You wanna lie down?
You like this house, Max?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
There are no twos, Max.
So the colored have enough trouble.
They're persecuted enough!
All right-so we can afford it.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh.
There were many men interested in you?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
So who won?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
I'm not.
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Let's get the kids.
Thanks for coming.
Would you leave us alone right now?
It's not a contest.
Take good care of it.
That for us?
What is it?
We've heard lots about you.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Are you my big hard hero?
Oh yeah?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What did you get me?
What?
No.  Did you?
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Otis!  No barking!
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
It's an unfair advantage.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
What are you saying?
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Yes.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
We have a gift?
Don't I find what?
Not long.
And I you.
Please, Ryan.
A little out of my element.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Easy tiger.
I've never done this before.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
That's very nice.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
Ryan.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I was impressed.
The charades.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Will champagne help?
How?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Okay.
Shit!
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
What did I do?
You're keeping a record, are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Enough about me.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Nevermind.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
So where should I put it?
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
You dance...
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Come on, Z.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Not that one.  Or that one.
Affirmative.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
...Not enough food?
ARREST HIM!
Wear this.
Not there.  Under the mat.
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Twenty-seven.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
What's your friend's name?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
I don't want it.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Why not?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
I would.
Are you all right?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Shall I light the candles?
I mean, after that?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Mind if I come in?
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
How would you like to go tonight?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
I am?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
To me?
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Yeah --
Naturally.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Mr. Sheldrake?
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
You threatening me?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Yeah, wasn't I?
What's this -- you packing?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
What about him?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Say, this is Snugsville.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
What for?
It's been hell.
Coming?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Where does she live?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
What !
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Who the hell are you?
That's good gin.
Sometimes.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Arch light.
Why they call you that?
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
Smoke !
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
I --
Will they attack?
What cat  ?
I never heard about that.
They nail him for it bad ?
You didn't like him.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Who is he?
How did they know?
Yeah.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
American weapons?
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
You smell that.  You smell that?
How big it is?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
What's the furthest you been in?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Fucking savages.
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
You were not coming here, to see me?
Do you?
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How's yours?
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Were you with him, when...
What's that?
He'll kill us.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
You think he'd of shot us?
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
What if I say no.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
That's 27, sir.
Well , who's in command here?
20   CONTINUED:  
23   CONTINUED:
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Avalanche season is coming.

Oh.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
What happened here?
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Thanks.
I'll go into town with you.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
Let's go.
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Where's Corbett?
Leave it here.
Does he have people?
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
Told you I'm fine!
Stay still.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
If Corbett's men find out --
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Alleged killer.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
How was it talking to him?
Call me as soon as you're settled.
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Do you love me?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
So what are you doing with a dog?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
Okay.
The stiff one eye?
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks, Melvin.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
And?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
I'll take you... why not?
How you doing?
Okay to say something now?
I should've danced with you.
Grouchy?
Boyfriend?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Well...
Was this supposed to be your room?
Can you not be violent?
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
No. Please, don't force him.
Sorry. What are those cards?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
What?
Did you... do something to him?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Please, just leave.
Now we'll both call him.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
What did she say?
Because...  ... you love her?
Picking on me won't help.
But you know where you're lucky?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Where you from?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
No shit.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
You can't --
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Okay.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
I'm on the scent.
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
What?
How did he know?
Um, five.
Get on the expressway.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
Bullshit.
Now what?
Forget it!
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
How?
Oh Jesus Jesus...
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
With computers.
It looks like white's game.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
More or less.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
My first take?
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Hey, where are you?
About?
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
No.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Not even a stalemate?
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Two way?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What?
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
They're worth less points.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
That's a ridiculous move.
Yes.
Yes.
Did you --
Were you attracted to me right away?
Four minutes.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
How much farther?
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
That stinks!
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yep, except a name for this place.
No, why?
I'm an idiot?
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Destroy the evidence huh.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Let's split.
Afternoon!
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
What happened to Katka?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
I don't want to ruin your day.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I've been around.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
She's tired.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Forget about me Kat.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Sure, they are students.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
They'll do it.
About forty minutes.
Okay?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
We_re not all running away
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
Enjoying our hospitality?
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
What is it you want?
And the students?
I'll need to make a phone call.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Out with Belinda?
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Were you with Jamie?
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
What are you doing here?
She's like some Puritan.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon!
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
I'm very sorry --
Get yourself a glass.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
I don't make small talk --
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
No problem --
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Looking for intelligent life?
Oh. Just not at school...
Or anywhere where people might see us.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
It's a start.
She great or what?
Your turn.
I don't understand...
How do you know this place?
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Help me live until I die?
I've talked to your father.
You know how to waltz??
How you doing?
It's gone now.
But if you could, you would?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
How about your family?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
I thought she built it herself.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
So what did we just make?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
This is 1952....?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
How old are you?
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Dad, you seen the drill?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Where did you get this?
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
That's all taken care of.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
What did you do to your hair?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
What'd they look like?
Then why'd you do it?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
I mean it.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What for?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Jack.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Nothing.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Why not?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
You know what I think?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I came in the front.
Are you sure?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
How you doing?
Is he upset?
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
No.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Everybody loves trout.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Hi.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Okay, friend. Start running.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Then what?
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
The girl I remind you of.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
It's a spittin' image.
Any sign of Buckaroo?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Let him go.
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
If you could, I'd –
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
...This'll sometimes help.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
How d'ya like your room!
Chet!
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
What do you do far a living?
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
You're leaving?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Jesus... You're leaving.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Yes sir.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
What did... What did he –
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
How are you, Nick?
How about the booze?
Yes.
You okay?
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
You should do something about this lock.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
I'm De...
How long were you dating him?
How long were you having sex with him?
Do you have a cigarette?
What's your new book about?
Even though you were fucking him.
I'm tired.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
How exactly did you hear?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
I like you.
Why not?
My wife used to call me that.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Yes.
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
What did you think?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
It's OK.  It's OK.
What did he say?
How'd you get in here?
No.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
It teaches you to lie.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
He had a girlfriend?
What you doin', son?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Catherine says you don't like her.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Homicide.
Are you kidding me?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
She's a suspect.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
How old was she when this happened?
I'm a painter, too.
Hey – it's the big A.M..
What do you think?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
Ouch..
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Paint it out.
Who's that?
You got a date already?
Your people.
You gonna carry that around all night?
What's the rush, John Henry?
Good.
She's good.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
I thought you hated this place?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
What's your name, man?
How can I ever thank you?
No, I'd like the scarf.
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So shut up and keep painting..
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother – when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
Hey, Rene.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
You don't have any!!!
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
OK! Goodbye!
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
I guess this mean we won.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
Admiring your handiwork?
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You almost sound enthusiastic.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Son!
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
And a very, very good one.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
You certainly will not.
You have?
But I can't can I?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
I love you, old man.
What is it?
Please be looking for me.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I was just hanging around.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Umm-hmmmm.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
No!?
You're not even listening to me.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
Maybe they're right.
...A bat.
How about, MR. E.
What now sir?
Al?
Up here, Al.
Why's that?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Now black rubber.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
Why do you do that?
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Chase?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
Go ahead. You can say it.
How high up would you say that is?
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
Where's the boy?
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
... How long have I been out?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I missed you, Lieutenant.
I answer to Grissom, punk.  Not to you.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
I understand.
Joker here. Can we talk?
And you want a --
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
You are on drugs.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
It isn't working any more, David.
Go ahead.
Hi,
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
shhh...
Two dollars please.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
It's very good Bernie.
Howls he getting on with the family?
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
This sucks.
What a dork. Huh huh.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Cavity search...?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
She sure does.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh no.
You'd better sit down, hon.
What?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
I feel really stupid.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Here's something.
I guess we open it.
She's only fourteen...
Honey.  Let's go.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Aren't you scared?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Wait for who?
Aren't you dead?
Handbook?  When...?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
All right.  Who are you?
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We're very unhappy.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
W... What is it?
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
Otho?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Just don't tell Lydia.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
You don't have a key?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I would like to walk today.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
A Black man gave me the message.
Would you care to take it, sir?
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
I would like to watch television.
Did you lose something?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, I like that very much.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
... Sir?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Please, sir.
... That is a very small room.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Well, ain't that the truth...
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Since you were a child?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Have you served in the Army?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
I have no claim, Thomas.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Yes. I will.
No headaches?
... Ben, really...
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Good night.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
This is not what I requested.
... So what does all that add up to?
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Did you eat?
Now?
How was it?
So how was it? What was he doing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
You were him last night, weren't you?
And he was with her.
Don't forget me.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Tell her you need to see her.
You fell in love with her first.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
It's Elijah.
The monkey.
A better friend.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Money, Miss Warts?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
No. I understand perfectly.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Dr. Lester. . .
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Moving story.
Emily Dickinson.
Yes, well...
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Tickets to Malkovich?
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Hello, Don.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
I'm getting divorced.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
Who's calling?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Good-bye, Maxine.
You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
You punishing Him, ain't you?
No. Sorry.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
WILL YOU STAY?
You don't sit with me!!
I want somethin' sweet.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Your mother all right?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Back stiff?
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Won't you be late for work?
MAMA!
She likes this dress...
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
He knew Baby Suggs?
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
You planning to do anything about it?
You don't know what I think.
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Fuck.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Her life is in your hands.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Excuse me?
Sir, please lower your voice--
His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Almost five!
I am the Walrus.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Burkhalter.
Kill that poor woman.
Am I wrong?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Ahh, not so good, man.
I like your style, Dude.
Howdy do, Dude.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Oh yeah?
I was talking about my rug.
You mean coitus?
Oh, no.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
And please don't call her my mother.
Dieter Hauff?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
What happened to your house?
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
This was, uh--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you--
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
The fucking point is--
The what?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
That's it.  I'm out of here.
Walter--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Yeah.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Huh?
This driveway.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Walter Sobchak.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Dude here.
Yeah.
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Well?  Aren't you?
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
What?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
You're hurt.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
You're hurting me.
How does it look?
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What do you think?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
Where were you, Whistler?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Put it back in park, Blade.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
What's going on?
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
What the fuck you doing?
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Stupidity.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Is something wrong, my friend?
Hold out your hands.
Why?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
You used me as bait?!
Any progress?
-- tearing me -- apart.
Please --
How could you be a part of this?
That's weird --
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
We keep in radio contact.
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
--and if she ever did--
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
What're you doing there?
Inside the grave?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Something was wrong.
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
Yeah, so?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Your body, your call.
Anna--
What?
Nothing. I dunno--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
You want a hand?
I don't think it was them.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Can't you like just divine it?
The witch?
Never would've guessed.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Mi casa y su casa!
Where <u>is</u> it?
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Be it still alive, James?
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
How're the cameras doing?
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
What--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
--it's less than four feet, just--
She got <u>paid</u>.
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
What?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
What?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
--I know!
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
Spare me.
I should check on Anna.
She's far from "fine."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
"It's why the witch kills children."
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Where... where you going?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Well... the couch would be all right...
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...You all right?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
...Where is everything?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
What night is it?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
What's the matter?
...What was that back there?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
What "what"?
...Just doin' my job.
You want me to kill 'em.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...it's too damn risky.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
What's this?
This.
That's not the point.
Is Marty here?
Thanks Meurice.
Where was I?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Are you Detective Williams?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
What is this? What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
Bull.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Shit. You better tell me something.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Yes.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I made it go down the toilet.
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Hi. can I come in?
. I. uh.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Yes.
You like to open me. don't you?
Shut up.
Do you love me?
You called me Jeffrey.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
What else is new?. right?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What happened to him?
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
So. what's next?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
Yeah. but.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
You want a Dairy Queen?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Okay.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. no. Why?
I should go with her, Sandy.
... Sandy?.
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah?
God. you scared me.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
This is it for me.
Nothing like this back home.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Surprise.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
You can't sell this to your friends.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
Goodness.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
No, my brother.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
George.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Three million.  I counted it twice.
I'm calling it three.
There's no room.
Are you comfortable with this?
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Derek Foreal.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
George.
Figured it out.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
What are you doing here?
What?
What do you want from me?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
But I have a visitor.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
No shit, Kevin?
Smith.  Hampshire....
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
What's happened to you?
What ... What must I decide?
But I haven't shot him.
I don't do that kind of thing.
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No ...
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Where were we?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
About three hours.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection, Your Honor.
Why would she want that?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
That's ridiculous.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Tell the court about that, please.
How did he look?
Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Why not?
Why did she say she was leaving?
Did you ever see her again after that?
Did you suggest any?
What did she say?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
I heard him say it.
No.
Then what happened?
What happened next?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
That bastard!
I've tried it.
No.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
P.M.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Why not?
How'd you meet Marsh?
-- And then?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Why would she lie?
You were brilliant today.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
I'm dropping the case.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
This is not relaxing.
If you want me to.
If he files are you going to take the case?
What's she like?
Humped
Yes.
It's more involved than that.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Eeeww!
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Are you from Washington originally?
No, really?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Oh, that's nice.
Where are you staying while you're here?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Then what happened?
You ought to write these stories down.
You sound like an artist.
And did you?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Are you all right?
Francesca?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
My mistake. I apologize.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Okay. See you later.
Oh.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
You want to eat something?
Take me somewhere.
Yes.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
I bet you could do a book.
But you don't mind.
Where was she?
Sleep all right?
STOP IT!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
I don't know. Please...
No. Don't do this.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Where you going?
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
About an hour ago.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Don't feed that dog.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Is it true?
Are you nuts?
'S up?
You think that's really him?
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Shit.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Looking to score?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What else?  Money.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
And what's that?
It's alright, baby.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
We didn't do nothing, Eddie.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
We know how this was done, eh?
No, Gino!
Oh, shit ...
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
You mean they weren't up here?
It's impossible!
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
He didn't see you, did he?
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Fuck.
What are you doing?
Where is the money?
I saved you.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
You're helping Rajeev?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
You can't kill me yet.
Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money. I'm staring right at it.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
I guessed you were straight black.
Are they really?
Caesar is your husband?
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
He's a launderer?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I don't understand - ?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Oh, God.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
-- he went inside! --
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Are you Treadstone?
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Who do you think sent me?
You have your passport?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Paris?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride out of here.
So what's in Paris?
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Okay, so you're a victim.
Where?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- just --
He's dead isn't he?
But the police --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.

Who is it?

Where's the dog?
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
What the fuck is he doing?
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
...your ducts?
...ixed itself.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Thanks very much Sam.
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
What's she done?
Er ... no.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Take her off the list.
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
We? Don't blame me!
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
They're gone.
Don't you like parties?
Oh, good!
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
What?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Sod it, it's broken!
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
Ha!!
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Is she dying?
No underwear?
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
What about Kanita?
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
Do you have any music?
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
Three legs.
The family know?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Would you like to come in?
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
The brakes are shot.
Whadda we bring?
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
They'll just keep calling.
Stomach again.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
What did they do with you?
Hold it down, okay?
You know what I...
Hi.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Of course.
I write for you sometimes.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
How'd it go?
Do others feel that you did well?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
What?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Goodbye, Paul.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
How do I get out of here?
Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
Is everything all right?
Bye, sweetie.
You don't have to finish tonight.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
It's not opinion.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I've got another story.
Jane?
I didn't think you'd make it.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
So what did you think?
It's incredible who's here.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
What happened?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Are you okay?
I'm almost ready -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Are you nervous, Walter?
Not even a little bit?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
Hi Walter.
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
May I please have another little kiss?
Nice night out...
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Walter...stay away from me!
That's word for word.
It was.
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
Would you pose for me for free?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I wonder what his deal is.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Dead Cat!
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Go home.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
Well...why murdered man?
You didn't mean to what?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
It's like...you've turned on.
You don't have to do anything!
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Well, um... litter?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice game.
Man has a complex.
No, we didn't.
Figures.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Dying.
You okay?
Something like that.
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I don't understand.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Is that your car?
How are you doing?
Where are you gonna go?
Things are kind of confusing.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Time to do what?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
None of your business.  God.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Not a pressing issue.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
Same one.
What!?!
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
That is so cool.
I don't get it.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
Pike.
What... are you?
Why?  Why me?
You think so?
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
Omniplex?
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
What are you talking about?
And the January Semi-formal --
No...  You want me to give him a message?
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
Death is like spring training?
I'm yours.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Just till I lose.
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
No!  You're playing with my mind!
I think you're real cute.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Neither will I.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
I'm Crash Davis.
See my hips?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
It's possible.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
What do I got?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
I was playing naked.
What do I gotta do?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
No.
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
Step outside, pal.
Where's Ebby?
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Ain't here.
Well, I'd rather not say.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
That's right.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
Yeah.
Okay.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
I'll call you right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Okay, Sammy.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
No, no it's okay.
Hey, Ace.
Just say so.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
All right.
Okay?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back -
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Hello.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
You go and put your things away.
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
Well, sir, I was just...
...and she doesn't always -
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Why not make them happy?
Sam, we got a problem.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
Why're you crying?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Right?
You sure?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Hi. Nice to see you.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
You can't make me stop caring...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
...under?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
The arrangement is over!
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Hi, Sam.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Get - Get up! Get up!
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
Just wait there for me!
You are not threatening me anymore!
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Yeah, okay.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
Well, I... I never tried.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Is this yours? Your pen?
When I left here with the money...
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
And here. Here.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
He's comin' over.
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
It's in all the papers.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
You got a round figure on it?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Okay.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm sorry.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
Yes.
I'm always here for you.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
Right.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Since when do you talk like that?
There's a lot of people here.
Take it easy, though.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Have we reached the epi-center?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
Women, huh?
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What's the catch?
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
You think so?...Selina?
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Good morning.
Nothing. How's your hand?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You are...
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Maybe.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Was someone in an accident?
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Are you guys all right?
Lady, don't let him do it!
How do we get back to the freeway?
That's your "rep."
If you know that just back off.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Lose the hardware now.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Any minute.
Oh won't I?
What makes you say that?
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Yes?  Yes?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Whose money is this?
The guy with the transplant.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You, I would've noticed.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
I'm still okay.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
They did some great job of reforming you.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I'm handling it.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
Pass.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Sure.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Satisfied?
Negative.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Stop the crying.
Seems like it.
I can see the benefit in that.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Seems not.
Why are you picking on me for?
I already called for an ambulance.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
So let's call this the usual.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Just cut his hair, you know.
Saw that one.
Good thing in a man.
Maybe he wants something.
Ask him.
He's back, Col
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Who?
How'd you guess?
You old-fashioned?
You all right?
You want me to ask you in, right?
What's that about?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
As different as it's possible to be.
Are you jealous of him?
Do I?
Did he come here too?
What you thinking of, hon?
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
Don't.
Happy now?
Come on.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
You promise?
Don't call me that --
I had to go to work!
So tell me.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Died...
You killed my Jody?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Why?
You like me now, Jimmy?
Say it again.
What's Fergus?
Not if you go.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Of course. I forgot.
Perfect.
You a handyman, Fergie?
Give him a cup of tea.
Why would you do that?
So?
So he knows your name?
Back in a minute, Jody
You OK about that?
Why do you want to do that for?
And who is she?
Hope not.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
I'm not a gambling man.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No, what's the funny thing?
She's a friend of mine
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Now put it back in.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Having two pints in the Rock.
We don't look on it like that.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Faster than cricket?
You stupid bastard --
What?
Don't run off, Jude.
What if I did?
And you know what?
What is it?
Now what?
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Reggie -- stop!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- please believe me!
Then say it.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Why not?
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
No, what?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Steal it how?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
Bartholomew?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
But you're -- divorced?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Why you lied to me.
Scobie?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
No -- not yet.
Are you going to listen?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert --
Where did he keep his money?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
Up there! It is up there!
Please, not on my account.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
What was it?
What your husband was mixed up in.
On the street where you live.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Who is it?
Yes -- that's right.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Stop that!
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
I don't see him.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
She's my daughter, Tom.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
is there anything you do?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Ok.
I'm not.
No!
Should we close down any eruption?
St. Michael's.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Can you get inside?
You fucked me up!
What do you know about my father?
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
Oh nice save.
Someone tried to kill me.
Mark invited me to the party.
Especially not your dad.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
I need to ask you something.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Yes?
On what side of the family?
What?
 Oh...
 Oh, shit.
Shit!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
A little early for a delivery.
Where do you want this stuff?
That's my business.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You want cash?
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Come on, get in the truck.
...up.
It happens to this piece of shit...

...town. 
...-er.
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
What?
Oh, shit.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...I'm not the psycho.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You wanna hit me?
...let live.

Holy shit...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Fuck! 
...do we?
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
...easy, easy, easy.
Get over!  Get over!
...wanna give it a try!
Come on...
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Gee, you think so?
 Okay.  That didn't work.


 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 

 Aw, shit  
All right, let's go.
He's crazy!


Keep still.
Oh, shit!

Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.

 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
A-And you  owe me...

Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Ow!  
They're takin' off.
Arlo, shut up.
Arlo!  Arlo.
Come here.
...-natic.
You got Elvis?!
And Brynner's right on...
Whoo!

What?
...-ta get outta here!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You did help a little.
You.
Us.  Owes us.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Oh!
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.

I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.

Well, that just about figures for today.
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
We've got it...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
They were all wearing hardware.
And I changed the schedule.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...-ple.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Of which we have more than enough.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.

Vaughn.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
Is this your establishment?
Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
I beg your pardon?
Not tonight...
...and unharmed, de-...


No.


I would've in another life.
...-time,  remember?
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
...somehow. 

Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Great.  All right...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Is Elvis out?
Thanks. 
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?

...is a perfect hunter.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...public drunkenness....
...beer.
...to talk, son.
...tunnel now!
  All right.
Yeah, I'm sure.

Arlo.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Look at that.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Always?
How did she get that idea?
Oh yes.
We worked in Chinatown together.
None.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Is she all right?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
How do you do that?
You've got her? Where?
What's that, Curly?
They don't kill a guy for that.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
In the garage.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
That's a filthy habit.
Why?
That's just lovely.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
I don't want it anymore.
Isn't that your number?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
What are you talking about?
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
No.
Mr. Gittes.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
K... Cross.
Yes... why?
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
That dam is a con job.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
We got it. We got it, baby.
When was the last time?
Working for the District Attorney.
...No. Why was it.
What about it?
The Albacore Club.
I saw him.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
That's good. Now what's her name?
I said I want the truth.
I'll take care of it.
How do you know?
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Oh my goodness.
There's just one question.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
He never even kids about it.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
That's a long fall.
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Then go home and forget about it.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
How did they get it away from him?
Apple core?
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
Will they really find work in Germany?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Now what can you see?
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
Then where's the money?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
How long's it been shut?
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
I might make him nervous.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Who else you been to see?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
Sixty-two thousand -
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
But, Mr. Kane -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
And the notice?
Is it good?
No, Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Emily!
Emily, you -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Toothache.
Where's the towel?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
How old did you say you were?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Yes -
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
At night?
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
I won't let you go.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Close the door, Raymond.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
I mean I've got a job for you.
Yes?
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all - 
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Hello, Brad.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Mr. Leland, you were -
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Yeah, all in crates.
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
She's plastered, isn't she?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Unnhh!
Well, if it's already too late...
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
I think you'd better leave now.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
So where is he?
God, isn't he great?
Can I use the bathroom?
Why aren't there any lights?
Territoriality. He was mine first.
When did you get back?
It's not what you think.
Well... kind of, sort of?
No.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
You're such an asshole.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
Then who operated the store?
Are you open?
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Pack of cigarettes.
You only brought one ball?!
That's what I said.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
You don't want to know.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Allan Harris.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
What's he looking for?
Perfect dozen.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What did he say?
Nudie booth?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
The milkmaids.
No.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Why'd you apologize?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Design major.
Helluva game!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Oh, my god.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I can't fucking believe you!!
What's that for?
May I be blunt with you?
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
What the fuck did you do that for?
What?
You're lying.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
You're a snake.
Who eats cock?
There's no lights back there.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
This life?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
You should shit or get off the pot.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
You still didn't have to choke me.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
What? When? When did all this shit happen?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Be careful.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
Yeah, but...
The porno mags?
Why did you agree to come in then?
What were you doing?
How much money did you leave up there?
Typically male point of view.
Oh, you think so?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It better be up to and including me.
No; who were the three, besides me?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
What do you mean?
He requested this?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
You had to tell him.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Here you go.
What are you talking about?
I didn't do that!
No way!
Is he staying here?
I think the lady called it.
I do about three-fifty, four.
Feel that.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
And... he told you all of this?
I... I don't know what to say.
Twenty bucks?
Answer the man.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Tucker?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I'm coming out!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Take the gun.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Can I count as fast as I like?
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
You can stop right there.
Resuscitation?
And I can't leave.
What if he can't?
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Let's be creative.
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
I can't believe you just said that.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Gabe...your arm?
Gabe are you alright?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Gabe!
Reach up!  Do it!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
What about you?!
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Have her come up.
On top of the peak.
I don't know about totally.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
What's the delay?
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Appreciate it.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Good evening, sir.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Do you feel that way now?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Crime?
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Blue eyes?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
No, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
I've done my best, have I not?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Don't read it - sign it!
Yeah... Pete the English.
Moloko-plus.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Shall we go to my office?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
But not now?
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Annie...it's Max.
...he's two floors below you.
This your current address?
You still carrying passengers?
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Something going on?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
...if they're wrong?!
Hi, Ma.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
You prefer nights?
Why not?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
What about that?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
You said you were visiting friends!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I can't believe this.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
What you mean, no?
Show up for <u>what?</u>
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
The man who hired me for this contract.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
How long have you been a hit man?
You get benefits?
Paid sick leave?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
And you believe me...?
Max?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Look, I'm sorry --
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
You going to warn him?
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So why are they after you?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
What are you doing?
Shoot.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
That was him.
He's why you punish yourself.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
You will?
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Now what?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
What about them?
My father's house.
Is that what they told you?
Then tell me what happened.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
How'd you get the picture?
Blue moon...
Blue moon...
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Agent Lowry.
I want to believe you, too.
What gave me away?
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
There's no plug to pull.
You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope there's a cartoon.
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Peter sends his regards.
Ellie...
It's not like you've given me much choice.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
You mean --
Do you have a minute -- ?
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
J39 Z186...?
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
There is no direct evidence, no.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Could we hear to China?
So who...?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
What's that?
Sounds like a Russian general.
But what about your research -- ?
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
You sonofabitch.
Someone tell me this is really happening.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
I flinched.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I read your book.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
Ellie, what is it?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
They don't believe me.
But --
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
Oh my God...
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
How'd you find me?
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
Yeah.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
What went wrong?
Go hard!
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
We saw the broads.
Comin' out here, Boss?
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Go git it, Luke.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Here's the Patrol.
Here, Captain.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
That ain't nuthing compared to what we used to do in San Pedro. There was this ensign...
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Where'd the road go?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Like I always do?
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Man Oh Man.
Back a buck.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
He'll never make it.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
I hate this...
Now look what you did.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
Yes.  Without question.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
The first two murders.
I was?  How you spell that?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Ruben.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
You're afraid of him.
Halloran.
What's that siren?
What happened to you?!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
I don't want this.  What are they?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
You messed with the scene.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
We were together six years, sir!
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Have you seen it?
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
What does he want from you?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
I want to see my mother immediately.
What's up with you?
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
What do you think of this one?
Really?
Hi, Mom.
How can I help?
Fuck me.
You did the right thing.
Tell us every detail.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
It had this red spot on its back.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
But you're checking it out.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
A small price.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Yeah.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
It's TV heaven.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Michael.
Not yet.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
This must be Beast.
How may I help you?
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
What are we going to do?
I love you so much.
Forget I asked.
Yeah.
Sure. Why?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
No.
Especially now.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
No, you've done a perfect job.
So will you?
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
What are you doing?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Who?
Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Hello?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And for my help I would get what?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Why not just steal another one?
Get that, will you?
Because you're the closest.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
That moron.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
I've got a way with people.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Okay, we're square now, right?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Yeah, French guys from France.
Everything.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Just find them!
There has to be.
No, I didn't.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I knew I should have driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
You lived there. You know the city.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Give it to me, Sami.
Anybody know about that car outside?
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
Who are you waiting for?
Why?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
She seems pleasant enough.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
You're back!
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I don't care about your sword.
Yes.
Why do you want to teach me?
You're home late... or should I say early?
You're already a thief.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
You don't seem to understand.
I'm tired now.
You're not married, are you?
I've missed you.
You're doing calligraphy?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Where is he now?
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Give it back!
Let's stop a moment.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Good.  And how are you?
What was it?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
No, not yet...
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
Save your strength.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
What in the hell... do you call that?
You buying?
No onions though, okay?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
You're welcome.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
Does she have a name?
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
That thing is poisonous.
I've got him if you want him.
I'm Kathryn.
Have we met?
Did you know Sebastian well?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Oh really?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Thank you.
Shut up.
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
Need a lift?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
Okay?
Need any company?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Please don't go.
Hi.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
You don't know how to love.
German.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
What was that?
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
Excellent.
What are you doing?
I was just kidding.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Just a kiss, right?
But -
Want to join me?
Is she with you?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Fuck her yet?
Loser.
Any day now.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
You amaze me.
Shut up.
Nothing.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Exactly the opposite.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You didn't?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Ronald? That's crazy.
I can't thank you enough.
She's not here.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
I love the smell of pine.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
You get your wish!
Mommy --
Did you ever make a wish?
The Farren house
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
She was very pretty.
I know that.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
Did you mail then?
Amy, not that old tree!
What do you want. Amy?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
Now Amy
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
Who are you?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You?
It's a pretty ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hurry!
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
No.
Wow your body's really hot.
There was a sale.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Can't you get contacts?
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
George bit you?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Charming Carlton.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
I've been here. What day is it?
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Peter knows something.
I think I just got my period.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
I'm cleaning my stove.
I think George knows.
I wish I only had your problems.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
Mark.
Script coverage?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Like what?
I really gotta get going.
Yeah. Maybe.
What are those?
What's wrong?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
What happened?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Hello?
You at least owe me the truth.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
Here's a towel.
I think I'm a werewolf.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
No, I have a cat.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
He was found a few blocks away.
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
He means the last that we know of.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
How long have you been here?
Doctor!  What brings you here?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Lost something?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why give yourself up?
Go on.
Which one?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
What does she say?  The woman.
Can I get my life back?
What are you doing?
You're a liar!
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
What is it?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
How much do you usually get paid?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
What's with her?
Right and don't embellish.
What the hell is this?
The Washington Post.
.. Nothing.
What do you think you're doing?!
You're fired.
Fine?
Don't call the Vice President!
Just don't call him, Alan!
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
What's with the cameras?
So you want to go swimming?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
They could put you in jail.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
In the car.
Fine.
Yes, Mr. President?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Something like what...
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You ever use it?
What?
Oh... Yeah.
You're leaving?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
They're crucifying you out there.
You really believe that?
I missed...
It could be fun.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
What?
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
What?
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Do they go to Henley Hall?
They're townies?!
I don't know.  I don't get it.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
What do you mean you don't know?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
I here and now commit myself to daring!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Charlie...
Where'd you find them?
So, uh, where are you in school?
Well, sure!
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
What is that?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
LOUDER!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
You really think I should forget her?
Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
She won't even see me, Pitts.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
What?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
How do we get out of here?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Not an option.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
I'm not a thief.
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
Yeah you did...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
It's not them...it's it...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Shut up! You hear me!!
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...it's okay...
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Man, don't go up there...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Where are you going?
Check it out!
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
You want 'em?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
He's real bad, Nick.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
You are his friend.
You like to call me Linda now?
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Rough, huh?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Linda, what's the matter?
What kind of beer would you like?
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
You think about it?
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
I like it, Nick.
No.
Great. That's great.
You didn't get a deer?
Yeah.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Who is it?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Kill him... kill him.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
I drive.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
She's pretty.
You need anything else?
I'll have a cup of coffee?
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Wanna try?
You should be in hospital.
You never want to find out.
But he was such a good cop.
I'm going to be a policeman.
Bye.  Thanks.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
You know that you're in my house.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Anybody can see that.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
She couldn't be gone!
Stevens!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
-- in gold.
Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
Now run along, Daniel.
Afraid ... of what?
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
You know darn well it is.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Dan'l Webster?
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
I think his leg is broken.
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary -- what would you do?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Mary --
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Mary! Come back ...
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
It is.
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
You're very perceptive.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
The code key, please...?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Go on.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
...I've missed you.						*
John!
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
'Roy'.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Roy?  You still with us?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Gene -- you smilin'?
These seats come out?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It looks like a whole roast.
What guns?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
How are you doing?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
That's it.
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
What the hell you doin' back there?
You tryin' to fuck me?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
You're full of shit ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
I want to talk to him.
What's the matter with you?
Now, you -- what's your name?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
You got kids?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Yeah.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
I used to, but I stopped.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
I never been up in a plane before.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh - Maria!
Hey, you okay?
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Why are you doing this?
This is Drake Bishop.
And if you can't deliver them?
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
So what?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Get Cynthia on the line. <i>They changed the fucking font.</i>
We're covered on legal with that, right?
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Talk to me.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
What did he do this time?
So?
How much?
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Make it plain.
What can you say?
Squash it.
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
I hope the block is still standing.
Mookie.
Jade.
...peanuts.
Jade, you're late.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Can you pay me now?
I would like to get paid now.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
C'mon, Sal.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Before I get off work.
Shit!  I forgot.
You a blue-moon fool.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
It's cold.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Just coolin'.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
You deaf or what?
It's e-vit-able.
I'm listening.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Some are OK.
You really think so?
Hey!  Watch it.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Pop, stop lying.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Take it easy, Pop.
No, I'm not it.
You're it.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
The name's Walter.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
I haven't seen you around here before.
I think it's just over there.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
Who's Principal Collins?
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Got any crazy eights?
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Just a guy I hang out with.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Nice jugs.
Owww.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
That's a cow, Harry.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
Captain Rob came back?
George Washington!
But my mom gave me the map.
What? What did we do?
Wait, wait!
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
She's one of a kind.
Sorry, Charlie.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
You had some questions.
Then where did you get this not my tape.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What?
So, when can we do it?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Okay.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
How was that?
Obviously.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I am strong!
To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
The evidence of what?
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
My thanks.
We have just folded space from Ix...
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Is he....?
Run!
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Stop him yourself.
Are you a Fremen?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Water of Life.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
It burns.
THE PAIN!
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Did they try and fail?
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Uh, beg to differ.
Who are you?  What do you want?
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Should I call a doctor?
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Last night was quite a romp.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
You really think so?
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
How long have you been doing this?
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's right...
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Dolores, wait!
For this one, we need $60,000.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Mr. Reynolds!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Excuse me, Sir...?
OUR picture?
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
You look beat.
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
I can't get it to go up.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
I'm really sorry...
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
You're sure this is gonna work?
B-but it's our money --
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
What?!
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
How you doing, Ed?
Ed --
I don't think so.
He's who we want to go with.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
Mr. Pekurny.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.

What?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
So he killed himself.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
She had white shoes.
I'm at the hospital.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi, Mom. 
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
I can't?
What are you doing?
What does this mean?
Yeah...
Cream rinse?
What do you want?!
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Okay.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I'm doing all right.
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Marcia's living with a singer?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Look, we gotta talk.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Hello.
Check forging.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Can I help with anything?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
We don't have foibles.
How?
Yo --
Tu
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
How'd it go?
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Mostly Tammy fans
Here they are.
NO, that's fine
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Yes?
What do you mean?
Where to?
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
What a surprise.
I hope so
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Exactly when?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Three twenty-five.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
What?
But other people can see them too.
She's doing this to get back at me
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.
Can I get you a drink?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
We talked.
Dudley, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
Will you work for me?
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
What?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Bud...
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Should I?
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
What do you want to know?
Whose shoe?
What do you mean?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
More or less.
Anything?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
I... No.
No.
No.
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Something like that.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit...
Glasses.
I need to speak to you.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I'll take your word for it.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
Where will you go?
When?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
It'll be our secret.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Working whores with squad two.
What happened?
DePinto's dead.
I'll come straight there.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Yes.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yes.
What <u>is</u> that?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I don't know what that--
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
None of your business.
I intercepted phone calls.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
What do you think?
That is one ugly sunrise.
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Them.
What the fuck?!
Fuckin-A.
Drive.
Goddammit--
Reynolds.
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Because my life is being ruined.
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
You tell me.
Than why can't you tell me.
Anything at all?
For your wife?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Who did you work with to get the--
Have you been working with Rachel?
He's got his priorities?
I know, but listen--
Good.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
Who?
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
What can I do for you?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
How's the trout?
Never.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I can't.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
He didn't.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
What's his name?
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Sure, go ahead.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
What?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
He's heard that it's escalated.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta--
Yeah?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
You think there was a connection to--
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
We'd have to--
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Daskylus…
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Actually, you sing.
You should come into the shelter.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Do they know them?
I'm impressed you can sew.
When were you most happy?
What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Why did you hold his collar?
It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
It's so cold.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
A broken car?
What kind of photographs?
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Have you seen Katharine?
It's Geoffrey under this.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
I believe I'm rather late.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
May God make safety your companion.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Or was it Toronto?
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
What do you want?
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Where did you find that?
Buon' giorno.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
What did you say?
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
The team is in mourning, darling.
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Excuse me -
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Why would anyone do this?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
I mean home.  India.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
Hello.
Only we have to go to work.
Pardon me?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
I'll come with you.
What are you talking about?
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Don't overestimate yourself.
I have a question...
Why are we speaking Chinese?
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
Are you...okay?
I've got something...
The Empress Death Mask.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
What the hell do I do now?
And--
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
Someone was expecting that.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Got it.
Thank you.
Aren't we early?
You're nervous again.
Aren't we all.
Ready?
Can you see the other PIRs?
They moved it.
Careful...careful.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
Okay, you're a thief.
What?
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Hmmm...44 long.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
That's where the Mask comes in.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
No way to take another day or two?
You have something in mind?
Jesus.
Hang on.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
--You're a cop.
He looks familiar.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Oh, it is.
She's calling the shots now.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
See you.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Whoa.  Remind me.
There's more than one?
This is a real nice place you got here.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Cause of the chromium.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
I don't even know how much money that is.
I can put them in a good school.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Oh, yeah?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
What medical records?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
At least they made an offer.
And you can't?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
Is that what I think it is?
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
What do you mean?
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
I want my fucking money --
What kind of things come up?
Whoa.  No shit.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
What's a demur?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
When?  Where?
Fuck Kurt.
I did.  Both.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Ross.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
What's going on in there?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Yeah.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
What are you doing here?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
You're not nothing, Erin.
You are someone.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
About this.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
Someone stole my stuff.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
Wow, that's soon --
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
He can do it.
He'll learn.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks a doleful farewell.
Give me that!
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
What is thy bidding, My Master?
I have felt it.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Sir, I was wondering ...
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Yes, Your Highness?
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
We've got to get out of this shower.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
You don't look angry.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
This ought to be good.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
A tremor!
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Leia!
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
That they are.
Price?  What do you mean?
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
Yes, My Lord.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Go easy, Stevie.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Oh Cuervo...
Shit.
All right, so I made another deal.
I'm already dead.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
See you in hell, Snake.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Where are they going?
Is that what I think it is?
What're you doing in here?
No screamin' shit.
Well, I'll think it over.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
All of us?
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Good day to you, sir.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
He can be no other.
Who is Merlin?
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
Guenevere...
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
What is this place, Merlin?
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Who does it serve?
The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
You provoke me, Merlin.
The oath. You didn't say--
What honey?
No, he's working on another book.
Hello?
Hi
Just five or six people.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
I'm gonna miss you.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
May I ask...?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
Oh, she'd love it.
Thank you.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
How are you today?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
So, what causes this?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Are you sure?
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
He didn't mention?
You wouldn't.
I didn't get you?
Oh yeah, since when?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Where's Regan's father?
Is she gonna die?
You've been playing with it?
You know how?
Captain who?
Who's Captain Howdy?
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
All done.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Another one. Had your lunch?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Do it again.
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Is that too tight?
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
The Lord be with you.
Shut up!!
Can you give her something?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Miss?
Yes
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Give me the keys!
Give me the keys.
What about tomorrow?
Twelve years.
Well, look at this.
They gotta go.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
What do you do to him?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Oh my God ...
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
What's wrong with it?
Count it.
So we on tomorrow night?
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
So what'd we get her?
Frank?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Jack.
You're getting cold feet about this.
Where the hell is she?
Awe inspiring.
Get out of here!
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
No.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
You all right?
Yeah.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
I figure that way we won't get confused.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
All night?
Why would I mind?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
You saw wrong.
What're you doing down here?
The party's over.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Nothing. We get nothing.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Fuck you.
Right.
Yeah, fine.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
So what'd you think?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
I sing now?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
What-?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Nine!
Shoes?
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Fucking.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Virgins?
Go ahead.
What'd she sing?
Wow. You ever see her again?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Oh yeah?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Brought it.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?
Save it.  What's he look like?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Forget it.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
I can keep the beat.
You were good.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
The both of them?  In there?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Jack.
Yeah.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
John.  It's good to see you.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
You mean if I get sick?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
What do you mean?
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
For being one helluva guy.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
Who is this?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
How's Loomis?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
It can't be.  It's impossible.
What are you going to do, Castor?
Stay away from my family!
They're too tight.
What are you -- stupid?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Commander, what are you doing here?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
I'm just having some fun.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
-- what?
What's on your mind?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
-- Yes.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
No...
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
And I know people.
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
She said that?
How’d you know my name?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Miss me, Jack?
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Are we...?
Are we finally being honest?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Kate’s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Here you go...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hello!
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
No?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Jack.
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
I promise, Jack...
Kate...
I'm sorry...
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Peter Lassiter...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Last night was great...
I want to see you again.
That’s totally see through...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
I found it!
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I had it at four.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Are you alright?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Where...where am I?
Reed? ... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Ben?
You look like an eighties rock band.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
I though we went over this.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Front page?
But I'm not done with the machine --
For science.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
I can...make it work.
What are you doing?
Victor, your scar --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
I know that. But what's the maximum?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
What is it?
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
A long time, with one man.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Thank you for saving my life.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
Doctor, what's wrong?
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
Doctor, we've just about had it.
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Sabotage? I don't understand...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Looks like quite a way to go...
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I can't tell you.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Yes, there is.
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
I'll never find my way through that.
The Wall's transparent...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
...Is this a fucking joke?
This is a new car, then, sir?
Can I see your license and registration please?
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Clear him off the road.
One of us pays the other for half.
Okay.
...Blood has been shed.
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Just a general way.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
You know what a disparity is?
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, how much money was that?
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah!
Yah.
...Dad?
Twice.
Are you calling Stan?
Norstars.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
lot. It's a limited -
I mean a parking lot.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
No kiddin'?
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
Stan and I're okay.
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
You're darned tootin'!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
No, see -
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
You look in his citation book?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah, that's me.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Linda.
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
And this guy is...
...Chief Gunderson?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
There's no one else here.
Cornelius!  How are you?
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
I'm just on my way out...
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
What are you talking about?
No, thanks.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Is that what you're calling it?
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
What?
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Hello?
How have you been?
You were in here last Thursday night.
You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Tell the other person how you feel.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Well, I have to file a claim...
Don't I?
What's that?
They're called "cigarette burns."
A nice, big cock.
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
But a good strange.
Hemingway.  You?
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Huh?
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
We don't need him...
Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week.
Hey.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
You have jobs.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...stop me?
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
What the fuck -- ?
NO...
Why... why... why... ?
What are you doing?
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Ain't that something?
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What did you see?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
I'm not sure I understand.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
What's going on here?
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Stop it, don't move him!
Shouldn't we pull over?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
Want me to drive?
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
That's why I was there last night.
That... him?
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
No.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
Can't you open the door?!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Fag.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
I'm sorry we broke in.
Knock it off!
You guys are real... aren't you?
Wow!
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Ever do this from a jet?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
This place is a trip.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
It's a guy in a cage.
Roundeye.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Where did you find this clown?
Thanks.
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Invulnerable.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yes you can.
Look, Co...
John.  My name is John.
You pathetic scum.
What's up?
I know...
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Who're you?
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
I... You're not going to understand this.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
But..How could that happen?
What if I was a relative?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Remember. One chorus and out.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
.....Me neither.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Your name was picked.
A list.
Free?
Please don't hurt me?
They said you're The One.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
I'm not married.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
Parry...
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Beautiful night huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
You a fag too?
I advise you to let us go.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
I don't drink coffee...
Well, id'n that nice.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
I know you're not.
Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
What?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
You're depressed that I come along.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Just finish eating.
Hey, mack!
I don't make the rules.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
Oh.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
It's none of your business!
Bye, now.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Is that funny?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
No, don't do that...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
Robert?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Robert, do you mind?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
Robert, I think you better just...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Don't call me "mack," honey.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Yeah, it could be adorable...
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Fine.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
So you got a girl?
So wadda you do with your girls?
That's it?
So what you think of me?
How you treat them?
Who gives!
Where you goin'?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
No.
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
This one's going to be even more fun.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Like when?
For sure?
Jesus.
My pleasure.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
Read this, please.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
I'm the Sufi.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Shoot.
Did you hear something?
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
John who?
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
I bet you do.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I really should change.
I mean put clothes on.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks for the great time.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
What is this....
I'm terrified.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
One.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
You want I set up?
So you're saying she moved out.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
Just give me a hint, all right?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You'll have it.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
Not really.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
No, I ain't got you...
Now that we've broken the ice...
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
That was close...
You wish.
I do it for love.
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Ah, an obvious choice.
Hello, Ford...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Three hundred.
Let's get serious...
Spunk, come back...
This is boring, guys.
Are you okay?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Gut feeling.
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
You'd said something about proof...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What's my name?
What?
Well try, okay?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Did they follow you?
There'll be someone else.
What's your story?
You're in show business.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
That's in France.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why not?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Who is that guy?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
Hey, Bo.
No, I don't.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
You're shitting me!
How do we get to the vault door?
Damn.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Deleon.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Where are you transmitting from?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Sorry 'bout that.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
You just burned the desk.
You sound...ground up...?
What's that?
What?
On the job?
Are you alright"?
What?  What is it?
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
What do I tell them?
Whatta we do now?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
He took your wallet?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
John, you there?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
I better give you my address then.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
You used to be on the job?
Nah, just working the job.
Sullivan?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
What're you gonna do?
How about a roll in the hay?
What're you doin'?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
It's dark down there.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Derek... stop.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
What happened that night?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
What d'ya got in there?
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
...And I said, shut up!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
It's all over.
So what are ya drawin'?
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Where'd you get this?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Which is?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
What's goin' on?
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
Anything else?
I'm kind of busy right now...
I gotta get back to work.
What's the problem here?
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Get up!
Tell me!
Does he know about what happened?
Wanna know how I did that?
Well?
Are you crazy?!
Don't do anything stupid.
Oh, my dear God...
I've told you the truth.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
A major prick.
Right.
What are you doing in here?
Where did you get that alcohol?
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Can't we at least talk about it?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
So, are you having fun yet?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
I can't swim.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
I...I don't know...
Yes...
I heard you weren't coming.
Can he really take us home?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rennie...??
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
I used to drive a taxi.
I opened thousands of brains.
Crosstown.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
But didn't we know it would happen?
We must abandon.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
I think we Nought to wait.
Where are you going?
He carries a gun.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
We're making too much of this.
How do you Eknow.
What are we talking about?
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
What about her?
She died.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
What do we want?
What else?
Your father said you might be here.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
Opening night, Lillian.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
Who is it?
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Where the hell are you?
We must have been heroic.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
A grandmother. God bless you.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Because life is good.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
They're my team.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
I hate the Mets.
What do you mean?
Why?
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes.
This could be it.
So does Elliot.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
You know what.
What? Come on, Paisley.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You're a clergyman.
No violence, please.
You mean Gandhi?
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
Do you find me stubborn?
Who is that young man?
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
They're sparing no one, I see.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
You're an extraordinary man.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Who are you trying to convince?
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
We don't have the manpower.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
How often do you test, Director?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Hello.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
Call German.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Again?
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
How are you, Jerome?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What do you think?
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
What <i>is</i> this place?
My medication.  I left it back there.
What are you doing?
The doctor will give you something.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
All it takes is a long arm.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
I'm in a hurry.
You okay?
You want to drive?
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
You been okay?
How's Estelle?
You go out much?
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
It's just been a while.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
That doesn't hurt.
I didn't. I just waited.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
There better be a guy with the
What do you want to do?
Do you mean that?
You've got it all figured.
You can't trust anything these days.
Only one car.
Are you hungry?
No scars?
We got this far.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Okay.
Can we make it?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
That's what I want.
You got it.
You can trust him...
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
What's the damage?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I've got to stop.
Well, he drove it into the river.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Who paid you to see me off?
What about?
She's nothing to do with me.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes. I met him last year.
Could you do me a favour?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
How'd you know where I'd be?
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
That's why you waited for me.
You sure about that?
I want to give you an Oscar.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Now tell me the truth.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Thanks for coming.
Where you going to live, then?
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
How'd you know Albert?
What you having, Jack?
What is it?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
You don't look it.
And what you going to do?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Now just a minute...
So shut up.
You wouldn't.
What you going to do?
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What's it to you anyway?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Jack! I didn't like that.
Scotch, please.
Not going, Jack?
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
You're not seeing me?
Deadbeats all.
We're stuck with this...
It is.
It's not.
That's right?
...that's right...
No.  That's absolutely right.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
The nurses?
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
You...
They have...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Somebody...
Yes.
How many leads have we got?
You haven't talked to him.
We're just "talking" about it.
A buck a shot.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Me?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
That's ridiculous.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Were the leads...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
He said we...
Yeah.
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Will you excuse us please?
Did they...?
Did the leads come in yet?
That's great.
Moss...Who told him?
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Mr. Levene...?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Shelly...
What about the other two?
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
I'm out.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
Can't do it.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
What happened?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Why I don't...
It was his idea.
I've got the check...
John: John:...my daughter...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Dave...
When?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
...yes...
Glad to meet you.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
The monthly interview...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Yes.
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I've got to talk to you.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
I can't regotiate.
What power?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
You cashed the check?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Have a good trip.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
We had a slight burglary last night.
Are you alright?
Did you like your party?
Did you see my present for you?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Yes, thank you.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Would you like some?
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
I understand...
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Within the compound will be fine.
That's off now.
He's not the same as when I met him.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Fifteen percent skim?
We've never sent this much with one courier.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
No strings.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
Kay, I told you...
There are still things I have to do.
You're a considerate young man.
Nothing is more important.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
I know.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
You want a war?
So what did you think?
What's that mean?
What're you talking about?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You and he are not doing things?
It's not what you think.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
These are your paintings?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
So you had a wife?
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
What way might that be?
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Why not?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
Is that really her?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Just take off the fucking mask!
You okay?
I'm up.  Thanks.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
You coming, Boone?
Hey, Boone.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Jimmy.  How are you?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Does the yardman come today?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
This is the studio where I paint.
Yes?
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
How's the leg?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
It seems she neglected to mention it
Fish.
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
They gave you only four days?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Get out of here, Ray --
Well, that certainly won't do.
Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You have my word...
I know you.
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
You seem a little hinked-up ...
You mean the poor --
Donny --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
How are we supposed to--
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Hey, Kip ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
So what are you gonna do?
You can handle it?
You don't think so, huh?
What are you doing here?
You hear me?
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
You okay -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Now what -- ?
Shit ...
You know of one -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Call 911 -
So I was replaced by Mitch?
What kind of trouble -- ?
What the hell are you doing -- ?
She's trouble --
So, you seeing anybody?
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What are you doing... ?
Tell me...
Is he still working here ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
What happened to Sway?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
My bag. My bag.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
I flushed it down the toilet.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Give'm a drink.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
Are you okay? What happened?
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
The third store down.
He didn't call?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Stop brushin' me back!
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
What do we got?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Thanks, Chuck.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
You and Morgan throw?
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
How'd you know where to find me?
I guess so.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
I'm not sure--
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
What's that?
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
What are you smiling at?
Yes.
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You're here quite a bit, then.
Jobs doing what?
--And confuse him--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
He won't be a failure!
So I hear you're taking some time.
I got one of those too.
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
Well, she out did herself today...
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
What?
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
That must have taken you a long time.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Tell me what you really think.
Watch your mouth.
Why not?
Why not?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
I know.
Don't fuck with me.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Five minutes.
Yeah?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
You grew up around here?
I bet you have a great family.
I have twelve big brothers.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Just for fun?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Is that what you think--
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Will ya look at her!
Ready, Pa?
I'd come back--
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Kinda pie y'got?
That's not your affair. Name.
Women?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
That cut you got?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, I never. What?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
She's settlin'.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Been doin' a job?
I stay in my own yard.
You ain't got to get sore.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
Yes, ma'am.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
I like the tent better.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Was Granma bad?
I ain't full.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Which ones?
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
You mean get off my own land?
But what does *that* prove?
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Morning.
Can you pick peaches?
You do not.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
I just play my own collection.
What's your business?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
It's always the little things.
You met people.
You're fucking psycho.
...Let me get my coat.
Shoulda brought my gun.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
No time.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
...About five years now.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
What if I come back?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Like a union?
No deal.
There you go. I left it blank.
Lisbon?
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They're not happy, sir.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They were very upset.
This is not good.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
You have.
What's a revival tent?
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
What the hell happened to you?
It didn't work out.
How did you get this job?
Why not?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Doesn't matter.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
I have a way with animals.
The answer's no.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
How did you meet her?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Show me again.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
No, you didn't.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Who's going to want me now?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
What about Grace?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
Aw... that's so sweet.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What was I saying?
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
When are you coming home?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Yes?
No. I am a "tubab."
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
What choice!!?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Where does this go, Diane?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Frank's a good man.
What?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Tom?
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Would you let me ride your horse?
Yeah?
Sure?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
I thought your mom's coming up?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Don't be such a baby!
You shut up, stupid!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
You're looking fit.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Right.
What?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Oh wow, we are fried.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Yeah?
Who's that?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
What did we learn in school today?
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Crash Override.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yes!
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
What the hell is going on?
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!
I'm Crash Override.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Make it our first date.
And you have to smile.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
How?
Ready?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Colonel who?
Mr. Belford?
Never fear. I is here.
Hello?
What the hell was that all about?
Murphy kid turn you down?
You said the worm was untreaceable!
What number please?
Just one moment.
Are you two okay?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Found it.
Why shouldn't I?
I do.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
You won't look pushy.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Where are you going?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
132 to 133 this is 134.
Get the outside shutters.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Where's that Deputy?
How's it powered?
It's over.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
He was standing right here.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
Lies.
What's the pumpkin for?
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Yes, you can.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
You locked yourself in.
You idiot!
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
We're all alone, aren't we?
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Sure...
Well, she's totally not here.
Okay. Later.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Not any more.
What about the bogyman?
No...
The bogyman!
Right.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
How?
I'm scared!
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Thorazin.
If you say so.
Pull up to the entrance!
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
What?
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
...with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Yeah.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Yeah.  How are you?
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Well, thanks a lot.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
You've been very cold to me tonight.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Mm-hm?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Me?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, yeah?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Do you miss Frederick?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Yeah?
That's really nice!
Go right over there.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Uh-huh.
Frederick didn't come with her.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
He's married...
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
Oh, God...
You treat me like a loser.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Hey, what's the matter?
My script?
Oh, so loosely.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Thanks for a swell time.
God!
People change...you know.
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Nobody ever said it.
You're kidding me.
You're okay, though, huh?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Hi.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Aren't you glad to see me?
A reward...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
...you...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Who would that be.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Evelda Drumgo.
Then you tell me, then.
What, What, I can't hear you...
How was America?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
I like Popcorn...
What reaction?
And how would you know that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
No, no, of course not.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Look at this:
I know you did what you could.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
What'd you say, hon...?
Waal...
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
I require...
You were given backup....
No, I don't get you...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
You should get Married.
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Fine, thank you, but
Because...?
Ask me when we get home.
I know where he is.
I want the money.
...<u>sadly</u>...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Thank you.
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Tell me why...?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Yes.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Goodnight, Jasper.
...sorry...
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
What in the hell did you do that for?
Do you really not believe in God?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...

Oh, I have to hear this.
All right.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
I was talking with someone!
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
What do you want from me?
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Shit.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Good plan.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
And your worst enemy.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Mute!
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
We killed them, didn't we?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You can be so immature!
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
You going to eat this?
Answer him dick!
We on tonight man?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.

Hello!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Who cares!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
You have it.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
I think I'm dying . . .
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
Him.
That.
Let's go overseas . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
I'm coming with you.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Bye, Dad.
Isn't it beautiful!
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
It's inside a moving car.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Sure plenty of times.
Since what?
GWEN?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
That was cold...
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Morgue...?
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
What's under that sheet...?
Wait... what the hell is this...
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Nothin'.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
I... I know that, John...
You were... very... inspiring.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
What is it?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
How'd it go?
Ticket!  What's going on?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
Safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Where are these toys of yours?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Right.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Well, can I make an appointment?
You must value your independence.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
What happened?
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Mommy!
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
So you don't have anything concrete?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
And it's a shorter commute.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said?
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Do you remember who gave us this?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
What -- what are you doing?
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
What?
Oh God.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Is it a king or a queen?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Promise?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Detective Bedsoe.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
You sure?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Good evening, Lieutenant.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
It will be a good harvest this year.
What do you think?
How comes it your are not afraid?
Your life.
I cannot stay.
Corpses?
Good evening.
You didn't answer my question.
Is it?
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why not?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
He's in there!
What now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
You know it's not safe here for you.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Is there anything else you need?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
You kept it?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
I guess so.
Talley.
What'd you find out?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Talley?
You're a funny guy, Talley.
That you, Talley?
Who else is here?
We can take it with us.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Donuts here any good?
What if it goes south?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
What do you want?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
We can't carry him.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
Are civilians inside?
Where are they?
That's not enough.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
She didn't answer.
What's wrong with the radio?
He says that his father's hurt.
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
It's mine.  Talley.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
How about you and your sister?
I think so.
He has lots of disks.
Where are my children?
Did you find the disks?
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
What happened?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
What is this about?
Please, I don't use guns.
How much?
Ten.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.
They fired a rocket at us.
Will you protect us.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
What do you mean, General?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
We are better here.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Here, have a sandwich.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Was there blood?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
You could have asked for a favor.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
What!
This won't do.
Has Roger spoken yet?
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
Go to the roof now.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I have a confession. When we met...
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
A little longer, Paul?
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
I have to stay.
We have to have a plan.
Oh, my babies.
Can I have your name again?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Twelve are dead.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What do we do with all these people?
How much beer?
What is this about no water?
Paul, are you there?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
There are soldiers.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
It's complicated. But don't worry --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Melissa!
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
-- I did: down here.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett!
This is nuts.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
You hear somebody?
We can do it...
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
What?
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
What are you talking about?
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
Jesus!
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- wit...nesses --
You think this is fucking funny??
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
First time for everything.
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Fascinated.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Pritchett: what is going on?
-- Eddie!!
Something....happened --
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
Where does this amulet come from?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
She says she's lonely...
Help me!  Please!!!
Good night Angel...
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Oh come on...
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
Whoa there...
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
We'll never know for sure.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Where did you find this?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
There's something through that wall!
Hello?
What will he do?  What does he want?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Wha .... ?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Uh-huh?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
What?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
What?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
How have you ... ?
But I don't know what's going on.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
What am I looking for?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
But you gave me a rose ...
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
JP?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Oh, I don't ...
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
That was beautiful.
Eighth room down, babe...
Hmmmm.....
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Alex!
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
That was close....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Wha--
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
That smart?!
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
...Hello?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Oh, Norville --
You mean you know about this?
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
...You son of a --
As a three-dollar bill.
I filed it yesterday.
I can't print this!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Muncie.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Ya know, entry level!
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
My pleasure, sir.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Sir?
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
Not even behind your back?
But --
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
Yellowstone.
She's got other problems, of course...
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.
What's this?
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
But, Mrs. Rand --
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Where do you think you're going?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
But don't you have to work?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
That doesn't sound like him.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
I've never given it much thought.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I told you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You want that?
I don't know -- I don't know--
In other words, I'm on trial.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.
Benjie!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
What?
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Hi dad.
I'm fine dad.
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
What you been up to?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
You want coffee or something?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Mikey Williams?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
You ask what the point is?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
How can you do that man?
What do you mean?
Shit. You're not planning --
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
No candy for me?
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
Yeah.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Did you tell Sandy?
When worlds collide.
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
And?
Right.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
He's dead.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
I don't know. How do I know?
Will, you can't blame yourself.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Who's that?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
Forget your pager?
Where you signed this?
What happened at that signing?
Are you sure about that?
Eight years.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Your friend's all business.
Fred Duggar?
I told you I don't remember.
No game.
Oh?
Down at the station?
She was only seventeen.
I suppose.
No.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Where's your back-up?
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
What are we?
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
I was waiting for you...
No, my beloved, my child.
Then blame the one who made her...
Are these not the answers you came for?
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
And yet you knew what I would o.
I want some more.
Why always on this night?
But you're the fairest by far.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
What was that?
The ship is sailing wihout us!
Or her, or her - or any of them?
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
What do you want from me?
You're sure?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Come, you're going to feed now.
Dear God, what have I done?
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
Why do you do this Lestat?
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
It's only a siren...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
How did you do that?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You can't look at them...
You loved Yvette...
Shall we go on?
But why did you tell her?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
I want off this island.
Get lost, you scared me.
Say yes.
That could break the machine.
The number's unlisted...
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
Karaoke -- perfect.
You get any sleep at all?
Karla!
Let him go. I believe him.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Checking the locks again?
Don't kill me --
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
Deep breaths --
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
You sure it's okay with you?
Julie? What's wrong?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
I trusted you.
...Why?
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I'll come with you.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
You think that's a good place to hide?
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
What's the matter, boy trouble?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
Where'd Estes go?
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
He is exhausted.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
Woman, what are you doing here?
What is her illness?
You know that sound, Oliver?
There is something evil about her.
It makes me fear her.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Go through with what?
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
What did you say?
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
Hey, who's that?
A boy?
Who is it?
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?
Hi, Daddy.
What?
Daddy!
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Old college graduate now, huh?
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
What boat you sailing on?
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
George.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
What gives?
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Holy mackerel!
Those Rockefellers!
Now look, did you buy anything?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Yes, sir.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Uh-huh.
How's that?
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Is it snowing?
Where's your coat and hat?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
How fast does this go?
It's okay, it's okay....
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Shut up.
Your dad must be really pissed.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Why'd they decide to move?
But the island!
You coming up on him?
Tina!
On your own time?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
We got a helluva tide this month.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
What about that camera?
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Do I have to?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Because.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Dad, I'm sorry....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Do you?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Mrs. Silvera?
Need a ride?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
I know what you're going to say.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
What's wrong?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
What're you going to do today?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What is it?  What's the matter?
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
We're alone.
Bullshit.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Can I go with you today?
They made me go with them.
Is that me?
What's wrong?
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
You're not going out right away, are you?
I want you to meet my cousin.
Terry!  You okay?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Mmmmmm.
About damn time.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
You do everything your parents tell you?
What's wrong?
Who wouldn't.
I want to go with you!
It hasn't adjusted.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
What's your plan, Brody?
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Yeah.
And what else is bothering you?
They're coming with us?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
You all right?
Fine piece of engineering.
Kathryn...
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
Change your mind?
You want me to stay?
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Yes, you can.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
Somebody better get down there!
Nobody told me.
I can have them walk backwards.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Why?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
I think they'll come out now.
He's a young one.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Musclehead?
'Course they're also so rich.
You were great out there!
Herpes?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Yes, there is goes.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Reach for the limit I always say.
How far away is filter number four?
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
That's impossible.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Gee, it's good to see you!
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Come on, sweetheart....
Where are you going?
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
How come it's my responsibility?
You knew...?
Where is she?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
We don't want any....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
Yes!
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
All you all right?
I'll be all right, Michael.
I want you to give up your work....
I enjoy his company....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You look tired....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I don't know how....
What's wrong?
A drink with an umbrella in it....
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I could take some time off....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Yeah....
Still tagging conch?
Let me speak to Ellen....
You tagging them...?
I know how to tag a damn conch....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Money is money....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
What about Carla's gig?
Stop that!
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Be my guest. What you got?
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
What does that mean?
Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
You want my advice?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
What do you mean?
Because I dislike her too much ..
We're going.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Ease off, John ..
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
What exactly you doing, John?
What if we need a back up?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
How do you know her hair's black?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Is this normal?
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
Yes, Sir.
Can I see your hands?
What color was it?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Sorry?
Ross told me.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
You think he still loves her?
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
He's happy, darlin ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Now.
Well, no you didn't --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Didn't hear it.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Now what did you lose?
Oh no.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
It's all going to work.
Hey you.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Don't worry about it, boss.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
What --
Why do you love me?
It's my fault.
I don't need you to "stick."
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Oh, thank you.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
I got it.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
You're telling me to dance.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
What's wrong.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
I'll get you some quick work --
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Not everyone has what you have.
I think so.
Jerry!  You made it --
Thanks for coming.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
You gonna get that --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
... dick?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
You wanted smaller.
One-two-three, swing.
They do, my brother.
Let's go the zoo.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Oh, my God.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Her new boyfriend.
How much weight have you lost?
What?
What did you say!
Eric! Are you here?
Udesky.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
Eric!
That does sound lucky.
Is it a rex?
How would you classify it?
They never got that big.
It looks intact.
Hmm?
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Eric, your parents are both here.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Bonitas.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
Hmmm.
Billy!
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Is there an antidote?
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
How could you possibly?
Dad!
Where do you think you're going?!
What kind of gun is that?
What?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
Where's the power and radio setup?
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
You version of it.
What's he got in there?
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Lava?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Can you set up?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
That little black line?
Give it more morphine!
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
But would we get the phones back?
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How long will this take?
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
There you are.  Out you come.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Okay, who's the jerk?
The movement!
So what are you thinking?
- - like birds - -
Are you sure?
I'm going with you.
It's anti-nature.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Unpredictability....
I can't see.
Up and down, up and down!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Are they heavy?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
I threw up.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Straight-A brainiac!
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
You got any kids?
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Where does he think he's going?
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Ah - - they're here.
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Let's go!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm a hacker!
Fifty.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Jesus Christ!
I think we're lost.
Hello?
I don't know...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
Three.  Where's my client?
A house?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Ten minutes...
What happened? Where's Jason?
Have you worked here long?
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
You work in the cemetery.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Did you see him?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, sir.
-- Eduard --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
Was there something else?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
When I have no reason to doubt.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Probably not.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
May I ask where your two warders are?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
I could always apply there.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Holy God! The mummy walks!
Jack!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Did you see her?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Are you gonna start it up?
Why? She's a junkie.
Enjoy.  Well --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Do you always have to repeat?
Yes indeed.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Gee.
Honest?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Can't you get him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there anything more I could --
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
It's kind of late.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What's the matter?
How can you do it to yourself?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
Then, close the case.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Does that distress you?
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
Will she pick me up after school?
What if she forgets?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.
See.  That's my name.
Did mommy ever see this?
Are you going to get remarried?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Objection!
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Did you wish to?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
Objection!
So do I.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
I don't recall.
How long was that?
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I'm not taking him with me.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Wow!
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
How should I know?
Yeah?
What?
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
I lost him?  I lost him?
What if I fight it?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
You're on your own, understand?
You're sure?
You ever think about getting married again?
Huh.. .Hello?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
We must go, Holiness.
Mama, my story.
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, now.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Holiness?
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Cow.
I will be back in a few days.
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
Will we be in this war?
Where is Alsace?
Tell me.
What is the size of our army, now?
Has anyone died?
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Please, come in, so cold.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
You will not come?
You have grown up very good.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
You killed him.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
You're a beautiful woman.
Why are we landing?
Go!!!
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Around here.  Yeah.
Keystone what?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
No!
He never said "go".
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
You take care.
Such the flirt.
He was an Indo-pacific.
<u>Jack</u>!
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Eh.  Fuck it.
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
And how would we neutralize him?
I'm okay.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You okay?  Kelly?
<u>Are</u> you okay?
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Thanks for the... bandaid.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
You sure?  I don't mind...
No.
We set?
He just came up screaming.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
What?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What is this?
Hank!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Should I?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Myra.
No. He won't come after me.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Lecter said a lot of things.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Miggs has been murdered.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why not?
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
Sir, that's great news. But how -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
No, I came because we need -
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
What did you do?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
So you ran away...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Starling.
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Yes... I did.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
He did?
What?!
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
What is it?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
You do not know what you are saying!
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Some say that's the way of it.
Will you consider that?
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
Yes. Go ahead.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Excuse me. What did you say?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Le mot d'ordre?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
What's wrong?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
And?
They found this?
Was there such a thing?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
DeJesus!  A readout!
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Jesus Christ...
No way...
I need more light on that, Four.
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
We're on backup air.
We made it!
Something wrong, Cobb?
No!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
I'm going inside.
Twenty minutes...
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Thank you, Martin.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Bullshit.
What happened?
Listen to it for Christsake.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
What's going on?
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
Look.  Water.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Clear for pickup.
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Don't spend all day down there.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
There are no others.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Yeah, one of them's out.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
And look what happened to that.
That's it all done, we are off.
Tom, this is our case.
I will.
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
Yes?
And?
Hello, can I help you?
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you doing, Plank?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Look. Go on, look.
My van is half full.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
--you're going to be on your own.
That makes it okay?
Well?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
So you knew this young man before?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Out of the Army?
Private Johnson!
Sam the Man.
Skinny?
You got a cause of death?
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Just wondering.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
What's that for?
Whole different story; isn't it?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
You look good--
Suppose not.
I'm a colonel.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
I got a pretty good guess.
PDA?
Well--
Didn't have a father?
So how come you got into all this?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
This place is a gold mine.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
You going to get married?
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
Black Seminoles?
You get much of that in here?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
So.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Reputation?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
You have somebody else out there?
This girl has a child?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Morning, Hollis.
I got an idea what happened.
Sam--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve called for you.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Why would I want to go there?
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Could of been. That was white people's business.
What about it?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
You got in late last night.
Can I get this?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Morning, Sheriff.
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
Field trip?
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Your boy, there--
Nice-looking kid.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
You think we need a new jail?
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
That's Butterfield...
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
D'Amour.
Right.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
He's with us...
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
Sorry.  You asked.
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
What did you find?
Oh Christ.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
He was the real thing, right?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
It's okay.
I was so afraid.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Yes.
Oh God!
No!  No!  No!
... oh... God...
Is it finished?
What the fuck?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Bad show last night?
Sure.
What makes you so sure?
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Shit.
Philip Swann?
Why'd you come here?
What for?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
My God.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Look, Ma, no wires.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Oh Jeez.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Nobody's better off this wav!
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
Yeah, they told me.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
What are you doing here?
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
What did you study?
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
I don't want to go home.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
But, I'm mean.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
I know.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
It's for my daughter.
You think so?
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Why can't it last?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Hello?
Hi, Lydia.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
I don't know.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
It's ok.
When are you coming home?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Hello? Yes?
I don't know what to do.
Will you please stop smoking?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
John! What are you doing here?
Peter, where are you?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
He spoke to you?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Well I know he's come here before.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Oh my God!
May I help you?
Yes... and you are?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
What's that got to do with you?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
We need to talk.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
So what?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
He was trying to tell me something.
How much time do we have?
Good seeing you again.
A lot of good that'll do.
You don't want to face it.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I plan to.  You want a tip?
Good of you to stop by.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Thanks again for everything.
Parents died?
What happened?
nothing.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Yeah, you met her?
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
Which one for tomorrow?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Careful.
You could make a career by telling me where.
I don't wanna see that.
So how long is this trip?
Nah.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
I don't know sometimes.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No.
I told him you looked like me.
You do.
What's up with that?
Thanks, Sidra.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
You ever think about going back?
For real?
So how come you could play basketball?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
You do act different.
What do I have to do?
I think we gotta kiss now.
I don't have to do what you say.
What's that?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
When'd you get this?
What'd it say?
What?
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Who's nobody?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Hey.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
You don't think so?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Just something I'm trying.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
From basketball.
One game.  One-on-one.
You're out of your mind.
What will this prove?
With who?
Not great.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
How was your game?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
What are you doing here?
Lucky kid.
From your mouth.
What do you want?
After five years.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
What kind of Cancer?
What do you want? Why are you here?
What the fuck do you want?
Don't sit down.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
Yes.
No.
Yeah.
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
What are you lookin' for?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Yeah.
This is my job.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Bye, bye, Claudia.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Please, yes.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Great, bye.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
You really use strong language.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
Yeah, of course.
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
Say what you want and you'll see --
Diet Coke.
Where's Richard and Julia?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
DAD --
It's ok --
How much you pay me for my help?
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Doc it's Janet.
Is it real love?
I have love.
What?  What does that mean?
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
That's right.
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You mind your own bussines.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I've been a good worker --
He has Phil right now.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
...ah...
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
I think you have the wrong number.
I'm gonna start rolling --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
It's all important --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
I'm sorry.
I wouldn'tve asked --
Psychology major?
It's not your given name, right?
He's in here --?
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Will you say my name?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Willa Cather.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Was there anyone that I know?
No.
Just once.
...Jimmy...
Yes you do.
Want me to wake her up?
Do you still have to do homework?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't want any water?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Hello.
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Pink Dot.
Phone number.
mmm.hmm.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
I don't have regular classes anymore.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
C'mon, man.
You coulda been in front --
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
No, M'lady.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
What is that?
He who is not with us is against us.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
How is he?
Hang himself?!
What you're asking is impossible!
But --
Bloody hell...
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Forgiveness.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
But why?
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
D'Artagnan, unready?
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Recent hours have been a shock.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
Silence!  I order you!
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
You've... memorized...?
Did they kill him?
Exactly why it should be given away.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Did you know... about Raoul?
What can I do for you?
What do you think?
What the hell happened?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Find out for me.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
What?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Are you alright?
Yeah?
Did you read today's paper?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Where is he?!!
So where are you from?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
You always carry a gun with you?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
No, but I'm listening.
And what did you do?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
And?...
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Ditched you?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Don't you guys ever knock?
What about him?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
For Christ's sake, why?
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
Run it.
Who is it?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
Something Lecktor said.
Will...?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
Who is it?
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
What am I doing here?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Do you see?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
It's Will Graham...
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
I don't understand.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He asked how you are.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
To do what?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Can you quit?
What will you do?
Mama was probably asleep.
What's the problem, Molly?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Maybe we should give it some time...
Yes. Who are you?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
Are you gonna kill him?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Yes, I thought so.
Yes.
Kevlar Second Chance.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
My hair is coming out.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Why Memphis?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
So?  What do they know?
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
I was very original!
Are you at peace with your family?
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
"Burlesque"?
We had a deal!!
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Why is he saying these things?!
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
You don't know.
The sewers.  Of course.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
You got the money?
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
All right --
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Right now?
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
When?
This isn't real?
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
I know what you're trying to do --
Do you know why you didn't make it?
And she knows what?  Everything?
She helped you?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
We need an exit.
That vase.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
My name is Trinity.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
How did you do that?
What the hell is this?!
What is this thing?
God...
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
Go!
That I would have to make a choice...
What are you doing?
You don't have...
Zion?
Holy shit!
How?
Why?
Operator.
Tank, you're hurt.
Operator.
What just happened?
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
Yeah.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
May God be with you.
Nervous?
Panther...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Michael, give us a lift.
Out!!!!
What's a'matter?
How much?
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
"Francis Macomber."
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
I'm sleepy.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You mean it's heisted.
Yeah.
-- But he does seem very nice.
Look who's talking.
Did you speak to the Governor?
That was 'Joe'.
Daddy!
Have you got a minute?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
I wasn't going to say --
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Well... goodnight.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
No.
Who are we talking about?
'Yes'.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
It's going to be great --
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Shall we adjourn?
What are their feelings?
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
In English, please.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Well, I guess he's found one.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Jennifer.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
The Board is waiting.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
Confused, huh?  About what?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
'Big'?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
Come again?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I've got plenty of friends.
Susan?
I came to see you.
Whatever you do.
And I'll be a visitor.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Yes...
'To bed'?
I'm sorry about --
Where are you going?
Well -- I --
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
But there's so much to tell you --
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
That's it?
No --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
When you go, I go.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Sounds fair enough.
I want to live.
Now I'd like to be alone.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
You were just curious?
What's okay?
Yes, I saw you see me.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Uh --
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
You're what?
Then what is it?
Which is what?
Those were my words, Bill.
I don't like what you're saying.
Are you threatening me?
Okay.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
You are --?
You want me to be your guide --?
It just occurred to me --
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Are you giving me orders?
Please.  Talk to me --
Where are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
This one.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Good morning, Dad.
Do you love Drew?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
I don't know, I can't say --
Are you relieved?
But what?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.

MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
66.
That's it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
No, let's go.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
Where'd you get it?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
You think you can bargain with me?!
You don't remember me.
They treating you alright?
What?
Such as?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
What happened?
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
On the house.
A BEER, please.
There's a dress code?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
This is your car.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I don't think so.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
What do you mean "bad news"?
Why?
What sort of questions?
Why?
What's wrong?
This is a drug deal?!
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
It is now.
* Thank you.							    *
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
And...?
Sal Maguda.
With Sonny.  110%.
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
I got to talk to my ADO...
How fast does that go?
Where's that?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Good samba dancing...?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Where would I go?
No part of it wasn't real.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Where we meeting 'em...?
Where'd you go?
Havana, Cuba...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
I am asking.  You to me.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
Detective Crockett.
How?
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
What are you talking about?
Out of...?
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Alonzo...!
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
Who are you talking to?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Must be some mess back there.
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
He's got taxi fare.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
They wrong?
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
You're what?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
What you got me up here for?
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
You really want to do business?
Getchmis olsun
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
Who?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Sixty Lira?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
...are you with the Consulate?
What's your father do?
And you?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
Oh we... we...
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
You're ayip!
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
Peter...
There's some weird shit here.
There's really people living down here?
The Department of Public Health...
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
What do you-?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
But the power...
We're no leaving you!
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Thought it was my week for that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
It worked before...
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
What's this?
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I'm not much of a critic.
Sure.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You're very kind...
No, what is it?
I can take it, go ahead.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Then light the match, Paul.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
To Misery.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Paul, I know you've been out.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Just leave it, all right?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Hey, Pete.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Yeah. They're in the semis.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
I thought you were over it.
I thought you were going to dinner.
Where is it?
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
Fight a bit of a cold..
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
It is, Billy.
Before we kill her or cure her..
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Do you know me?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- this is very disconerting..
They've got a book for this?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Much.
Where do I meet you?
What did you think you were doing!
No.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Roger that.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Luther, say again.
So what did he say?
A visit from an old friend.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Satisfied?
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
May I come in?
I just need you to be safe.
What happened?
Claire.
Whoís dead?
I donít think so.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Sorry, am I interrupting?
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Higher.  Higher.
I thought I was going to see Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whatís going to make him do that?
Such a nice ass.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I don't like him.
I have no money!
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
You haven't said anything.
You're not sleepy?
You look tired.
Yeah.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Mona?
You haven't once said you like my dress.
It's wrong to just let them go.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Loretta. What's that smell?
This is good. Uhh...
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You don't know nothing about it.
I was dead.
Your blood.
What about Johnny?
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
I'm marrying your brother!
You don't get along with anybody!
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
But that's cause he don't know!
Who painted that?
That was just so... awful!
No thanks.
It's really cold.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm really afraid.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
He's coming.
No, I'll tell him.
Hi Loretta.
Have Something.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
How near is she to death?
Alright. A month. In a month.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
WHAT?
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Hi.
Your hair's different.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Don't make yourself sick.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Maybe I should go?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
No idea.
Can I get another one of these?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
May I walk with you a ways?
Temperature's dropping.
I'm a little cold.
Rita. Rita.
Look.
I don't know.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
You got me.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You're using coconuts!
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
King of the WHO?
Well, how did you become king, then?
All right!  What do you want?
A what?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
Are you sure he's got one?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Nu!
Ni!
There!  Look!
What?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Yes, Lord.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
I think I'll go for a walk.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your name?
What is your quest?
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Rather what?
I don't want land.
Herbert.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Right.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Hurry!
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
They're all saying the word ...
How much?
Sixty.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
What are you doing?!
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
The place is a mess.
It's what the maids are for.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
It's the Queen's decision.
I wish to see my mother.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
Too busy looking after themselves.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
What are those?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
John?
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
What's her excuse this time?
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Has he been hurt?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Read it.
What do they want?
Where is my son?
What is the matter with him?
What do you mean?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Talk to me.
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Has anyone seen Greg?
Sick?
Can you turn off the game?
So how did it know my name, then?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
You mean we learn the rules...
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You don't get it, do you?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Okay.  It's West.
So that's what we almost died for?
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Mom?  You're alive...
So what do you think?
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
But I'm not broke.
It's been a very strange day.
Howdy!
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
What did I say?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
It will work out.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Can you tell me what happened?
Yes?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Mulholland Drive.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
What's wrong with that?
"You're still here?"
"So... surprise"...
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Rita... I know what you're doing.
Wally Brown.
You're so easy.
Nice wallets.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Now where do we go ?
So what do we do ?
What are you doing ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
How long till the room fills ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
You okay ?
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
I thought you made this place ?
Be very, very quiet...
You okay ?
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
When I think you're ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Bruce has just awaken.
Will he make it out ?
The power went out in half the park.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
How's your foot ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I will. How's Shelly?
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
And she saved it.
She's beautiful.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
My mother can't have any more kids.
Then what did she do?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
What can I do for you?
I guess you have.
He's writing. Hello?
Your mother?
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Get married?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Does it work?
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
My mother stood on this very spot.
It's not his fault!
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
An adventure?
Write me a poem?
What's it for?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
I should do this myself.
Then you'll be all set.
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Hi!
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
I'm just tired.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
It would be fantastic.
He's a great poet.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Ex...ex, ex...
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Can't you see it?
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Stiffs??
Excuse me, what about the job?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Uh huh?
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Harry, I really think she.....
Hi.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Home sweet home.
Yeah.
This is where we are.
Rock?
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
Dad??
Goodnight Vada.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
In the garage.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Please.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
Who's that?
No....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
Is that your camper?
Shut your big fat mouth!
I would.
I like my name.
I won, I won!!!
Where's Daddy?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Hey look at this, no feet!
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Where's your bike?
No, I don't wanna.
Sorry.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Run faster they're after us!!
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Well when you get older, you just have to.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
You better not either.
Seeya tomorrow.
What?
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
He can't do that to me!
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
Two words.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
How about...
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Exactly what?
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
I think he's been fired.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Please come, please.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Waiter! Check, please!
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Don't you throw up on boat?
No accents today.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
The Big Hurt, huh?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Lower.
I never forgot that.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
I said, I've been real tired.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
What's he running for?
National television?
Where'd he ever see us?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Okay.
Hey!
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Mr. Green?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Did you see who that was?
Who's that?
How do you know?
We don't mess with accessories.
Mom?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Fungus?
Bye.
Hello.
I'm not sure. Where?
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Hello.
Yes.
I can do benefits
Hello. John Triplette.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Come on.
I'm Opal.
He is to a lot of people.
Southern California.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
Ryan O'Neal.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You think it will?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
More or less.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
What kind of pies do you have?
You got something you want to do?
Looked like an interview to me.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Sorry about that.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Describe Mallory.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
Through the power of the simple word---
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
Yes.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
How's it working, Scotty?
It's gonna be beautiful.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
They done that too long in my family.
It sure is.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Want to talk to you.
You a union man?
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
I know.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Yes, aren't you?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
How about another beer?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Surprised?
That's right.
How did it go?
Hmmm - good coffee.
You know how to box?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Hi.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
A whole lot, Frankie.
See you, Duff.
I'm Duff.
How about a drink?
What happened?
I asked you somethin', boy!
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Couldn't get the words out before.
Seems a little loose!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How often does he get like that?
How often is that?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?
Come on, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
He's your son.
Got a thick feelin' here.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Hey, bro.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
She's ready to go.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Who got you into this?
Never heard of him.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
How much time you got left?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Want to fucking answer them?
Where did you here that?
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
What about before that?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
On a good run... yeah.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
It sounds like you.
...Feels like you.
I'll get the car.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Is he going to make it?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
My God... these people are insane.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Like what?
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
What's that?
It is?
What?
No Roger from op/ed?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Who told!
Anita!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
You need my help?
What is this?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
He is totally crunching on you.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A--flack jacket.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Uhh, no.
Do you even know these kids?
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Rob's?
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
Oh.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Wow. This must be big.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Sure, why?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
So what are you thinking for college?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
This seat taken?
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
I don't know.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Josie, you look Rufus.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
You got your room straightened out yet?
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
Are you nuts or something?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Here.
So, you feeling anything?
I feel like a jerk.
Anything?
What is it?
It's gone now.
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Hi.
What's so funny?
'Morning.
Jess?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
Morning.
Yor dad picking the music again?
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
I'll need to take her things.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Jennifer --
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Freddy?
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Are you okay?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
Just until we get things under control.
Stop blaming yourself.
Then maybe you're ready.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
I've heard crazier things this week.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Nancy...
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Somebody else is out here.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
I could've saved them.
My God.
Freddy.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
I'm in.
Lovely to meet you.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
And then I... right.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Too complicated.
Why?
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Cartwright.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
That's not true.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
Well... how have you been?
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
He's bringing a girl?
That's right.
Yup.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Still loves you though.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
What do you think?  Good move?
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
Well, fire away.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Right -- want another one?
Martin -- your customer.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Buggered?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Any more announcements?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Cool, huh?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Oh my God...  Hello.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Spike!
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
What's going on?
Are you sure you...?
Bad news.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Why?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Yes, Mister Harding?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Yes, ma'am...
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Oh, I had them removed.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
What is it, kid?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
In ya go...
Say... God Bless America!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Yeah, where we going?
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Ya know what, Fred?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Giving up?
He can't hear you!
What's your plan, Mack?
I said out!
I'm the coach!
Don't you have any clubs?
Why not?
Who told you that?
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Gimme the ball!
I wanna see it...
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Poker!
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
I don't, Doc...
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
You look pretty healthy to me.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Somebody's coming!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
What are they?
Please follow me.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Yeah...
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Yeah!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Yes, I see it! I see it!
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
What kind of crap is that???
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
At this hour?
What are these men doing up wandering around?
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
She was your sister.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Who's dying?
No.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
He's out by the pool right now.
Hi, Peter.
Hey--
How about music?  You like classical?
You okay?
Hi.
Yes.  I am.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
What would you call it?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
You're Damon Bradley?
Wait.
Sure.
Excuse me?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
How about the other one?  His friend.
But somebody wrote those songs.
You don't have any idea?
Why don't you ask him?
But what?
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
You okay?
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
So?
A phone message.  Only--
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
I'm hungry.
What's that supposed to mean?...
What did you say to her?
I never even got to be single.
Faith--
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
That was really sweet...
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Peter found him?
Joan Collins stayed here.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Maybe I can change him.
So...
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
And you are?...
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Oh.
It's siesta.
How old are you?
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Well, where are they?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
I wish I knew.
Working hard?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mm—hmmm.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against— 
What the hell!!!
Wow... .
It was you, Charley... .
What makes him so special?
They play pretty rough.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
What's that?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
How do you like that one?
Listen, you like beer?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
And if you don't?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
What are you going to do?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
Edie... Edie... ..
I've been sittin' in the church.
Terry— what's happening to you?
You... .
I know what you want me to do!
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Thanks just the same.
My pigeons... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
This is my business.
D 'n D?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Better.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Give me a double.
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
My favorite little cousin.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Can't we get out of here?
What can we do?
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
But they are not yet one of us.
...And what is this?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
Well?
I would have time for my own pleasures!
I understand, Master
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
No. No! No!
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
He wants us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
You didn't visit him in prison.
Why not?
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Adele?  You in there?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Do we need him?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Just that she got away.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
Jack?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Nice disguise.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
And she saw you?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
We made it, didn't we?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Shut up.
Daniel.  Listen --
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Leave it where it is.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
What do you want to bet?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
I bet.  How much?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
Good luck, Richard.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Why, are you famous?
That's funny.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
That's my dad.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
Don't leave me.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
So she did help you?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Wait in the car.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Really?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
It's a little late for me.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
You busted out?
And so now you're off to Glades.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
What's going on, Glenn?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
It's a guy you know.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
You like to sit down?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Technically.  They're separated.
Can we change the subject?
No thanks.
What are you thinking about?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You wave back?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
How do I look, mama?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
What?
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Foley's got it.
I found a rubber.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Do you always stutter?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
They ready, Earl?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Good shooting, Danny!
Didn't you say test the limits?
How could you do this?
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Nah, you go on.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Yeah.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Then wh-where do we land?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
Oh, this is Betty.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Leapin' Jesus!
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
You see us as capable of such a blow?
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
Do you have to wear that hat?
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
They're waiting. Come on.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
We're here on the sofa bed...
You got a Tab?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Oh, Charlie.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Are you for real?
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
You don't?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
I have a note.
I'm excused.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
What happened to you?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
You look exactly the same.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Sort of.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
What do you know about hypnosis?
What will they be made of?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I came to say goodbye.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
What?
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You want me to help?
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
It's weird...
I gotta go back and do my chores...
You ever think about running away?
How long have you been here?
Yes!
What in God's name... ?
What was the file name?
Thanks, you guys.
Don't apologize for me.
Jerk... What did you say?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Whatever.
Thanks for coming in.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
New baby?
Congratulations.
Kids are great.
Thanks for your time.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Who'd you get?
I'm a law suit.
Get it?
You survived your first gay party intact.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
What?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I know a good probate lawyer.
Opera?
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Do you need a break?
Yes.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Where's Dad?
Mom?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
We're going to draw blood.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Now that you mention it...
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
He was doing a great job.
Don't wanna miss this.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
What whispers?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
How many you see?
Just give me your hand.
You'd die for them?
What, switch what?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Well? Is it just the pump?
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Some prophet guy?
Imam. Slow down.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
...then we saw this.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Think about that reward, Johns.
Well, what's it look like now?
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Take it.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
'I am not a missing link.'
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Objection!
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
All right --
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
We got off at the wrong stop.
Who are you?
Shouldn't we be moving on?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Gorilla hunters ...
Who put them up?
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Sustained.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
What is your proposal?
Of course.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Sure.	In a cage.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
You want her that much?
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Would you like to come along?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Yeah?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
I'll go with you.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You don't want to hear about it?
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Indefinitely?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
The brush-off, huh?
Don't I even get my face slapped?
I think I'd like to dance.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
Dance?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
How did you meet him?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Bad?
He could hardly help suspecting you.
What time is it?
Us?
Why?
Anything I can do about it?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
See anything?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
Would I want to?
Me?
I think you mean that.
Please answer my question.
I'm sorry.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
How about a cup of coffee?
Time for a little chat?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
You'd be breaking the law.
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You asked me where it all came from.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Got a moment, Inspector?
Send that?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
What do I get for it?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
Right.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Not too hard, is it?
Was that about the right angle?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
May you what?
I never saw it before.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
I am a fool.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
No doubt about that one.
No.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Get out of here!
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
History books are first onto the bonfires.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Thank you.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Shall we go?
Now first of all, tell us your name.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I'll have some of that.
And some of that.  Sorry.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Damn.  They're early.
Me too.
You don't trust me.
Did she talk about me?
Not here.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Now, top secret file.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Hello.
What period?
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It was last year.
Don't point it at James!
Ah, Susy, it...
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Don't you gamble?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
What's this?
You're a fucking dead man--
Talk.
I can't do this.
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Surf conditions okay?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
They're on their way to Maui.
Time for lunch.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Bye.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
You saw what?
You're looking well, Dutch.
That's over the border, General.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
What in God's name...?
Where the hell is his body?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Who are you going after next, sir?
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
For the whole night?
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
Not... quite.
All right.  How much for the week?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
This isn't a date.
The Rex.
I think you'll approve.
I'm sorry.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You always been rich?
What id we run into someone I know?
Real genuine guy.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
Edward, I can't.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I didn't think so.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Looks slow tonight.
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
It was great.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
What kind of school?
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
They will serve salad.
Then you would use your--
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Get out!
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Will this do?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
What?
Oh no. No, please.
Who gets Humperdinck?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Yellin.
Rise and report.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your guess is as good as mine --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Now?
No --
-- yes --
-- anything you want --
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Thank you for everything.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
-- get back, witch --
Think it'll work?
Your grandfather's here.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Oooooooops!
Yes sir.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Here, don't panic.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You're going to jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Where would you like to eat?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
To failure!
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
But he has long hair!
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
You, Blum go Motel.
Get car.  Get car.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Nietzche...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I live there. Alone.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
Now, look...!
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
What's your interest?
Why?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Yes.
She stole some money.
Please!
Yes?
Is something wrong?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
What thing could we be in together?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
It's been three.
Probably on his way back right now.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
You going to wait here for me?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
You can't go up there.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
You're very... kind.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Is your time so empty?
Why do you ask that?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Is anything wrong?
Is there?
We have a problem.
Mary is Lila's sister?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.
I'll get your bags.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Just before she died she came to--
He's inherited a fortune.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
No-
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Thousands?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Take me down there.
What are you going to do?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
You lie!
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
But what about lunch?
There's no hurry. It's early.
Why didn't you eat last night?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
That's the way I feel about it.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
What! What are you talking about?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Are you giving me this straight?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Meaning what?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Which one is me? The horse?
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What!
No kiddin'?
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
No kiddin'.
That's the one.
He might get some publicity out of it.
That's what I said.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
But I have some friends waiting.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
She is the soul of that statue.
I'd know him anywhere.
Yep. Everything settled.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Could you?
A place you've never been.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Here comes Daddy.
Of course not!
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What'd you say, Brother?
Let's go peep from the living room.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Wow! Brrrother!
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
That's what she would say herself.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
I am ahead of you.
How goes it, darlin'?
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Boys? You say to me boys?
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
She hasn't actually done anything...
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
It's twenty after one.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Is anything wrong?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Your baby?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
I see. Outside it.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Oh, no, ma'am.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Rose, you don't have to.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
And... ?
Who cares?
Kittle...
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
You shouldn't litter.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Jiminy Christmas.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
Wh... what... ?!
What's the plan?
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
They... they shot me.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
What's mine say?
It doesn't say that.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
I can't believe we're stealing.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Can't I?
He went to pick up lunch.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Arriving tonight
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Yeah... great.
Alright?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
We're screwed.
The gang's all here!
This shit was Ming.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
Yes, my Master.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Han!
Are you all right?
You got her warmed?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Shall we try and go around?
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Here we go again.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
What did he say?
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Ugh!
What's he saying?
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Come with me.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Yes or no will do.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
You!
I was telling the truth.
He might be.  I don't know.
Yes.
Uh huh.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I'm coming with you.
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Maybe we could try it this way.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Hello.
Good God.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You're OK by me.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What a guy
Feeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...Guess.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
Why?
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
They're all the same.
Would ya take off your glasses?
...What?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
I thought it might be cute.
...And he called the reporters --
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
I can't go out.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
...Paulie. Stop now!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
My side.
Damn.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
This a con?
Few minutes?
Nine minutes!
Six!
Yo' yellow, old man.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
What?
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
Make your teeth yella --
Makes your breath like garbage.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Did ya win?
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Think about it.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Whatta' those?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How am I doin'?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Hey --
Don't get mental, man.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
I got whiskey here.
To see ya train.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
So you decided to help him after all?
What was <u>that</u>?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
So where is it?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
You tricked me, damn you!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Keep reading...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
A challenge, on my life.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Good marrow, father!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
I take thee at thy word.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
A most courteous exposition.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Do you have it?
It's under your seat.
I don't know.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
From Interpol?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I better be getting that.
Are you alright?
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Where's my information?
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Sent it where?
Then I guess we're set.
Nobody's going to do that!
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Yeah.
So this is what, a test?
Long enough to shoot back.
It's been known to happen.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I ride with fat-boy...
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Sorry I'm late...
Where to?
He says this is their block.
Something like that...
Same thing, isn't it?
Lovely, isn't it?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You sure your friend got the right place?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
I never made that claim.
You were behind the door?
They don't have the package.
Time to quit.
Would you stop with that...
Because I don't walk away.
You have to stop doing that!
It's the Irish tape we want.
You put everything on the line because you...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Can you get it?
Sort of!
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Oh, you would have done great.
What are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
We don't know that.
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I've got one condition.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
Here it is.
It's gonna be o.k.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
Dwayne's dead.
What are you talking about?
It's too late...
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
Yeah I'm fine.
OK.  I love you.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
A satellite dish?
I don't know, Booth.
Test the product?
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
I guess we can get started.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Anything I can help you with?
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
A lot of men come in here?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Don't hurt me.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Are you hungry?
This whole place?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
Yeah.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Winner!  Four, winner!
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Yeah, that's right.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Oh, you American?
You bring American money?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Hello.
What are you doing?
Goddamn you got a small ass.
It's my job!
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
No, no, that would be crazy --
Who?
You sound like that all the time.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
It's a long story.
She's getting undressed.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Fine with me.
See you in the next world.
Fine.
I think we should stop talking.
How was the sex?
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Vegas...
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
That your gate down there?
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
You move well.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Who the hell is that?
What is your name?
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Good job.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You talk very fast.
Help me Rhonda.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
That silly-ass look on your face.
You make the plate?
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Like that.
What are you doing here?
What a surprise!
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
What kind of assignment is that?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
What?!
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You sonuvabitch.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
I do.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
What is he up to now?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Really?
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
In vino veritas.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
Yeah.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
What?
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
I think so.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Lost!
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Does it matter?
Used?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
You okay?  I'm closing.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
I'm really rooting for this one.
What?
You tell Maggie.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Who is it?
About forever.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I do.
Walter.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
Oh!
You should write something about this.
You're a basket case.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Right.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
What?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
What?
But he saw you, right?
It's a sign --
This is a photo of hair.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Magic.  It was magic.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
No.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
No.
Hey, my plate is full.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
When's the latest time you were out there?
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
Eighty dollars.
Dad --
Dad?  About last night?
Fine.  Fine.
How did they get our phone number?
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
This one's for both of us.
Listen to this --
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Dad!
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Did you call that radio station again?
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
What's wrong with Annie?
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
When I found you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
What about camping?
Do you like it?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
It's a little derivative.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Hi.
Oh.
He's ten.
It takes time --
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Well?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
Who? A scab?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
To the mine?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
A fighter, huh?
What were they saying? About you? In there?
You are no good to me -- in jail.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
A meeting?
Where are you going?
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Well, if that's possible ...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
What can I do for you?
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Ride 'em cowboy)
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh God.
Oh. Hi.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Is that how you play?
What do you want from me, Colette?
Who is it?
I'm kind of busy.
Really, I don't want to.
Oh shit
I'm hurting.
So, why'd you want to see me?
You wanna score some go-fast?
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
Why?
What the hell is that?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
By not disgracing her memory!
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
But I just met you.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
You think this is funny motherfucker?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
The Mexicali Boys
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Where's Bubba?
Report.
Casualties?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
A private, sir?
Good luck, John.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
Last I knew.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Where?
We left them eighty-eights.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
It's worth it.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
Glad of it.
It looks like a Renoir.
It seemed appropriate.
Over three-hundred.
What is it?
The men said, nine.
That only leaves three.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
Caen?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Uh, Captain...
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
You alright?
Oh, yeah?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
What do you think?
I don't think so, Captain.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to go, sir.
So, where are you from?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Hi.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
So, what's your point?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
I can put that together.
You like it?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
Morning.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
Lloyd?
You're not listening to me.
Do you love him?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
You think you know what this money is?
Mom, please?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Busy?
Are you busy on Friday?
Actually, I think that I...
I'll go.
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
So we can finally talk?
Then call me tomorrow.
I think you should wear that.
Yes.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Why didn't you tell me?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
You told your dad?
What do you want?
Okay.
How's it going?
It's your castle, man.
PAIN!
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
What?
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
No, really.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Now you're back.
Well, let's find him.
What's your name?
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
You know what, you'd like her.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
Scherner told me something else about you.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
Like this?
Good.  How's it going?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
Pots and pans.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
No way.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Lemme take you home.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Go on, untie him.
Two.
Where's Sid?
And now, drum roll please...
A twist ending if you will.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
So we found a compromise.
You have every right to be upset.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
This is all too familiar.
Jesus Christ!
Let's go.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Who are you?
What do you mean?
Someone’s trying to kill me. I need the police.
I have rehearsal.
Time to change numbers again?
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..it's really about family and tradition...
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
Take it off.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
I'll be right back.
What was that?
Do you work for her now?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Asshole, Can't talk.
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
Nope.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you mean?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Oh yeah, how?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Detective Kincaid?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
What?
I can see nothing's changed.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Why would the police come to you?
Stop following me.
You're not a detective.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Thank you.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Your life?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Just because you knew her?
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
But you know my favorite name?
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Hello?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
How'd you do?
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
Ready?
I thought she was dead.
She can't get both of us.
What are you doing here?
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
So...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
I wanna let go. I do...
So why did you dial it again?
Popcorn.
Uh-huh.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
No.
What did you say?
What do you want?
Dial someone else, okay?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Please don't do this...
No... please.
...please... no...
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
What are you doing here?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
I'll look for it.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Hello?
Are you okay?
...so call if you need me.
Stop. Right there.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
I thought everything was checked out.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Come on, Sid.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
You've left unfinished business before.
Have you heard?
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
What?  What?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
I don't believe it.
Where we headed?
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
A woman...
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
You just met me.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
This doesn't make any sense.
It could be nothing.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
Did you read them?
What?
He just may be nuts enough.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
And?
How was it?
Sorry about that... I just...
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Wait... just wait.
We could use about fifty more men here.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Where's the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Well... what the fuck, man?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
What is it?
Stay with him.
Tell me it's not true.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
How long have you lived here?
I don't know, with this case.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
You all right, sergeant?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
Got a warrant?
He cometh forth like a...
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
You got any more orders, Captain?
I didn't give any order to fire!
I say NO!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
And maybe you lie...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Nothing for you to see.
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You ask her!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
No...She's not...
Stay out here.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Where?
Where are you going?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Where have you been?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
What?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Hammer?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Twenty-three, to be exact.
You did not like the speech?
Oh
Oh…what have I done?
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Do you know that house?
Thank you, my lady!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Are you writing?
How much?
Interesting.
How long has it been?
No, your marriage bed.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
When?
I have a wonderful new play!
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What's the title?
There's never any
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Is it going well?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Who is she this time?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Cut round him for now.
By God, I wish I knew.
We are lost.
Kit
What is the story?
Ethel.
The daughter of his enemy.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!

Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
But your voice  Have they dropped?

She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Better fortune, boy.
My lady!
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
You would not leave me?
Moonlight!
I know how to fight!

Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady Viola.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Your name?
Where did you learn how to do that?
She loves me, Thomas!
Like a sickness and its cure together.
What of her bosom?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
I'm only asking what you think.
He made it clear.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
You mean immoral.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
Don't you worry about that.
How much did you pay?
I want to secure it.
They know.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Parked outside?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
Did you know --
I thought you stopped going.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Well, she had problems --
What sort of car?
You want me to kick it open?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
I don't want to. It's different.
Stop nagging.
Sshh.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
It's about the burglary.
No, nothing, sorry.
Two?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
I see.
Yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
Two hundred pounds.
Expecting anyone?
I thought you'd gone to work.
So let's go.
What?
And that's why I think you fit in here.
You get the job done.
What guy?
Here?.
What do you do?
What's it about?
I see.
Do you think you could answer that?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
And he's a patient of yours?
The human condition.
I write about it?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
No. I haven't seen them.
I suppose so.
Both, sir.
You can tell by the intonation.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
I thought you were in a good mood.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
What?
That's George.
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I can see that.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
But aren't you...
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
Shit.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
No kidding.
That you're just like your mother.
How is she?
I went to school with her husband.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
You're late, George.
You do it.
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
How long you had this?
You would?
You don't seem very sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Jill's coming with us.
No.
Why not?
And?
It was after you, baby. After you.
Sit down.
Look, either come in or stay out!
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- you are.
I don't know what gets into me.
-- sure.
-- very nice, very nice.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
So I'm saying it...
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
God, there's Lester...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
-- took a bus.
I have to see you.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Now, George --
You're different.
Honey?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Whether or not I'm going.
When is that, George?
A friend dropped me off.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I've got to get her out of here.
How come you took your own car?
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
But what?
It's good you want to do something, George.
When?
Tonight?
I know it, I know it.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
What do they look like?...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
I wanna hear about it, George.
I wanna hear about it.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
I wanna hear it from you!
Why, why do you think that is?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Me!
She's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

You're home.
No you won't.

I was too old.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
Of course not.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Jackie Shawn.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I am? I mean why?
C'mon.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Sort of.
Good for you.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
That bastard.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
-- there's not much room --
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Do you have children?
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
No of course not.
Everything okay, son?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Are you having a good time?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
Dad?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Maybe he showed me something.
Yeah.
It's so pretty.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Mom?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Mommy!
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
She eh... interferes.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Beg pardon?
Bill, how do you do?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
What do you want me to do about it?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Did you find anything?
Somebody did that to him.
Get him out of here?
Jack!
I...
I don't know.
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
I'm gonna go now.
Mr. Ullman?
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
can of itself be a problem.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Right there.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Can I tell you kids something?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
Yes. Go away.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Please, Uncle Al.
Rattling. Rustling.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
Your mom's not around, is she?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I saw what I saw.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
What if I say no?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I think I hear it!
But I'm fearful!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
His ashes?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
You are so damn sexy.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
Oh, girls.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
What?
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
A cigarette?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Clarence!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
St. Anne's?
The reason?
Miss Van Cartier.
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
I got it.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
It never solves anything.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
A vote?
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
What are you doing here?
You saved my life.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Ten flights?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
No nothing.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
I am?
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
I have?
Vince knows you're here.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Then one day they find you.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
A nun?
There she is!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
You didn't shoot!
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
A sweater.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Sister Mary Patrick?
He's not like other guys.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
She's... she's a nun.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Certainly not.
They spend two days in chains.
You must have missed your mark.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Maybe you should take this.
Damn... damn... damn...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Very few, if any.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
The Widow Windsor.
What is that you wear?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Listen to what you say....
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Out there.  What do you see?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
All I saw was their lantern.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What books?
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Why... why are you like this?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What are you doing?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Katrina...
Where are we going?
What was that?
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
She has confessed.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
Thank ye.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
About a half a mile I think it is.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
I want to watch T.V.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
You like that Vaughan?
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
But maybe just for awhile --
What's you last name?
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Maybe they needed it.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Yeah.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
You all right, Mama?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Why are you here now?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
He just got out of the state hospital.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Yes.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
Will that be cash or charge?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Are you closed?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
I didn't know you took pictures.
How'd you get started?
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
It's kind of overwhelming.
But they're all the same.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
I'm all ears.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Still, you can't just write her off.
There's just one thing I want to know.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
Seventeen.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
Open it.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
No thank you.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
So what's the time?
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Mostly what.
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
Here and there. Around.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, it might be.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
None.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Closer to eight.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
My mom.  Would be the problem.
You don't believe in God anymore.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.
Cigarette?
You want me to say that.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
What else could it be?
Well...
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
Are you absol...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Improved...how?
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
You don't see any blood?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
Done what?
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
What message?  What motorboat?
With ME?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Sugar?
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
Are my seams straight?
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I'm a very sick girl.
How's the bottle?
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
We better have a drink first.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
Yeah - Josephine.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Did he get fresh?
I always did.
How did those holes get there?
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
We could dye our hair.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
We can have it altered.
It doesn't matter.
I don't like no witnesses.
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Afford it?
Really?
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
What's happened?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Which one is yours - the big one?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Yeah.  Real hot.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
You collect shells?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Josephine.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Been waiting long?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Three?
What a beautiful fish.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Harmless - how?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
What else is there for me? 
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
PLEASE!
What'll it be, sir?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Christ, Amy.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Say something. Please.
Does Kat know?
Huh?
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
And Kat was fully clothed.
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
You’re not even listening.
Mission accomplished.
What does your gut say?
Six thousand, right?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Subtle?
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Hi.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
What’s he do anyway?
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
You want me to let him in?
Dad!
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
So why’d you let him go?
What do you say to that?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
That does it...
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
You bet we is!
Goodnight, Daddy...
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
You know somethin', Daddy?
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Ready to go, Mama!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Good night, Mama...
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
What did he want?
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Why the fuck not?
Is it Cartman's mom?
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
You're late, Cartman!
Mph rm rmph!!
Goodnight, honey.
You've got a stupid accent too.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Thank God, that sucked ass.
What's going on, Chef?
Hello there, children!!
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Donkey raping shit eater.
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What's that?
What's the password?
That's gonna take a long time!
What's a butfor?
Be careful, dude.
It's so very cold...
It's okay, I am done for.
That was sweet!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nowhere.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Shiteater-
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
But I-
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
What's going on Terrance?
AGH!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
What did you do today Satan?
What if I just left?
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
You're certain of that?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
Why, didn't they say?
You gotta think of your old age.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Barnes?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
We don't.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
Are you ready?
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Oh my God.  What happened?
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
But how are you going to escape?
Dawn.  Come in.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
So close...
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
I'm homesick.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
What the hell is that?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
I'm looking for a man.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
You have orange whips?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
You know, Elvis bowled.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
What's on your mind, Miles?
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Need some advice, huh.
Where'd you get this ball?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
We ain't married no more.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
Hello?
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
It depends.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
Junior.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
132, 154.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Like this?
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
I'm a bowler.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Where did your brother escape from?
Whoa.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Do you talk with your mom?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You told Junior that we did it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
How do you get this thing down?
You should.
Can I come with you?
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You're really pissing me off.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Norman!
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Where is it?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
Then why am I here?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
You don't think weapons are important?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
How much damage?
Ted?  Captain?
So?  What's the problem?
Gimme a report, I want --
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
What?
Some sort of lead or something.
How can he be missing?
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
Wait a minute.
Beth --
It's not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
Wait a second --
You don't believe me.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
Three to six hours.
It's an idea.
I'm sorry.
What is it, Norman?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Did you?
But --
That's bullshit.
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
Beth --
Beth, stop it!
How's that?
No.  I don't think so.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
When did it come across?
Is it coming from our own computer?
Don't be defensive.
C'mon.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
What is that?  That noise?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Beth left?
That's right.
Did I kill her?
Push her, c'mon.
Her legs are in the way.
What'd you say to him?
She told me what you said, Norman.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Well, if it's a discharge --
Good idea, Ted.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
What report?
What report?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Well, he's polite.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
What was it?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
No, not anymore.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
You saw through me?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
What is it?
The Kiber Crystal.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Here come six more... grid two!
There are only three or four left.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Did you read her mind ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I don't believe it !
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Or...?
Profile's wrong... there.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Are you the boy for me ?
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
I'm gonna miss you.
Shhhh...!
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Which way ?
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Good good, then it's all settled.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Let's go.
Don't be a hero...
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
All dead except one, sir.
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
The examination is a normal function.
<U>Why</U>?!
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
<U>Computer off</U>!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Captain, what's the next move?
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
What answers?
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
Nope.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
You get what you pay for.
That: in an act of...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Goodbye.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
What I need to <u>say</u>...
About <u>conflict</u>...
Hello.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What happened?
Uh huh.
What are you doing down there?
Fix my glasses.
Gonna' be good as new.
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
No, that's true.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Well, where do they hold court?
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Wat...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
It's Marty on the Coast -
That's right.
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Mornin, sister.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Her...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
You do...?
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Aren't you ever in school?
No.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
I know that...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I know...I know...
...wants a piece...
And you know what...?
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
-- she's got 'religion.'
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Where you off to?
Why?
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I know the feeling.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I want to make a good film.
Why?
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
You can't write it?
How do you know you saw it?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
My oh my.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
<u>Find</u> it.
We got the permit.
I want them thrown in jail.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
...not at all...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
...the damn thing...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
You think so?
Why?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Ben!  What's wrong?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Scream.
How would you know sh...
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
What's Thursd...
You don't like his friends.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Hold lunch!
What if he's kidnapped?
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Help me here...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
But you told us to starve.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Queen of diamonds.
Poof!  You're happy now.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
So you're okay.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
It's not good enough.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Are you here?
Because you don't really seem here.
Napalm.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
It's a huge moment in their life --
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Yet another spaghetti night.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Machines do not EAT message.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
However many.  It's not enough.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
I'm sorry, I just...
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You WHAT?
Look, you've never liked me...
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
She hasn't mentioned this.
Moi?
Oh, my God.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
And I'm going to win.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Thanks for coming out.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
You ride with Annabelle...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
Why in the world would she t...
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
Where you goin'?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Nice to have you here.
Really? How many?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Speak English.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
We used pull.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
Fuck!
The same. Same as what?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's over there.
Nigger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
No.
I hate reading.
OK.
I dunno...
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
So what's going on?
Oh, that's too bad.
That's too bad.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
That's good.
How'd you get it?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Scooby?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I said I'll lead.
What now?
Forget about it.
What do you mean?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
How well do you know this place?
How's the arm?
I insist...
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Possibly some coffee?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where is this...thing?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Give that back to me.
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
What about the President?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Yes!
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
Well, Mister President.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
That is correct, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
I see.
I guess so.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
It was a honest mistake, sir.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
What else could it be?
A through H is correct.
Check.
Just the missiles.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Where'd they get you?
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Check target approach.
Second safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
Primary bomb is live.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
He's dead, all right.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Are you sure?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
At the bottom of mines?
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
How long were you in there?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
That was really great.
Typical male.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
It's your birthday?
Jesus Christ.
I'd get bored.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Wait. Hey, man.
Tim...
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Oh, you were in the band?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Come on. Inside.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
I know. It's okay.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Mm.
Uh-huh.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
Tim, what are you talking about?
You lied to me.
This is my home.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
No.
What?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
About things that are important to me.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Yes, I stand for -
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Can I talk?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
This is ridiculous!
It was a racial incident.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
What?
What feelings?
Of course.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
What?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
To his hotel?
I've run out of words.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Go.
You really suck, you know that?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hey, where's Erica?
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Yeah?
Would I get paid?
Yeah?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What's that supposed to mean?
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Is that Jeff?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Your manager?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
I'm going out later.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
No.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
I sure do.
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Let me explain something...
Don't use big bills!
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
I've been hoping to run into you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
I was afraid of that.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Who else ?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I wrote that with my heart.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
What's that?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
When did he say it, Norma?
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
How come?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But what will happen?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Home?
I don't feel like it right now.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Western Europe.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Like it?
Let's talk about us, not her.
You're not afraid are you?
I don't love you any more.
Away. From you.
That makes it worse.
You think so?
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
Wait. Don't leave me.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
Finished your estimate?
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
They think I have a concussion.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Hey, where you going?
Someone's chasing him.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
What are you making:
I can do that.
I'd rather not talk about it.
Your hair looks the same.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Why is he acting so strangely?
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What is this place?
Others?
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
There is a way.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Yeah? What do you want?
Mr. Roebush?
Tuesday.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Brad?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Gus?
The boss wants to see you.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Man, what is this?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this whitemail?
Can you do that?
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
Who is she?
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
There's no rush.
I thought you'd never get here.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
Where's the light switch?
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
He's the only one who can operate this --
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Lois, what are you doing?
Uh. . .
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
Maybe I could try --
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Who ????
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Let's go to my place.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
"They?"
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Everything on it?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
I like trees.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
Why?
You must be freezing.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
Yes, but will you honor it?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
They make my eyes itch.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Gee, I don't think . . .
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
No Paris?
Superman? Has something happened to him?
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Awesome!
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
What's he going to say?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Whoa. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
I'll deal with you later.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
I know, but  --
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Mother...
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
Know what?
Big night coming up?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
Can I take you to the airport?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Super...man. Hmmm...
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
What are you doing here?
You and your real estate.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
This??
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Krypton!
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
See?
Mr. Romance...
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
No news is not good news. Y'know
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
I mean the other one!
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Two.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Who...who...
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Oh.
How old are you?
Can you really see through anything?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Yes.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
What...does it turn to?
What happened?
I understand.
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Are you sure?
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
You're leaving.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
I have to.
Because I have to.
Why did you do that, Billy?
What do you mean?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
You've talked to Billy?
It's for the school bazaar.
Is this mine?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It's like a song.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Should I keep reading?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
I don't want you to lie.
I have no questions.
Have they ever been busted?
I'm in a car wash.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
DADDY!!!
Yes.
News?
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
What for?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Yes.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
I was scared.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
What do you remember about the accident?
That was great.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
She'll move away.
Come on boys, break it up...
Did she accept?
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Not being partial, are you?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
I know Manny Davis.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
He means that much to you...?
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Back?
Don't you know who that man is?
Yeah!
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
Who else phoned?
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Why me...?
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
We stick in each others craw.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
I made you write a beautiful song...
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Everything.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Excellent.
I'll deal with the police.
No!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
It, John.  Not him.  It.
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Where do you stand on all this?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
I guess so, sir.
So what is it?
What's that mean?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm sorry.
Of course.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
How come?
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Tough, tough!
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Steve Arnold...
Who warned you?
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Yes, I know who he is.
That's an outrageous lie!
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I'm sorry.
I have illegitimate children.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
How can I know such a thing?
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?
Major.
What?
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
You can't to that...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Alright, the beige one.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
You volunteered?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Let's go.  Time to move out.
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
My whole life has been combat.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Admittedly...
Did you play recently?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Clean out your locker.
I'm so sorry.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
This can't be real...
I'll give you a boost.
There goes a thousand dollars.
What exactly do you do?
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
What are you doing here?
Where'd you get this?
Do you mind if I sit?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
That's a lie...
They did the same to him as they did to you.
What?
I don't know.  A lot.
Get us out of here...
They won't...
It's mine...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
About me?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
But, will you?
Yeah, almost...
It's them.  They did this.
How did those... ?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
You don't need me...
Where?
Guess!
I've been so lonely.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
What's the trouble?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
What's this about?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Hinchberger wedding.
I don't like her.
What?
Anything wrong... ?
I wasn't expecting you.
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Luke, can I talk to you?
It's not going to hold your weight.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Was sure she'd be in here.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Someone is playing with you.
I don't know.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
This is where we're going?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Is she asleep?
Yes.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What do you do?
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
No.
Jeez.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
David.
David?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I've never had a pedicure before.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Are you sure?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
As soon as you get dressed.
Italian?
Italian.
I like the colors.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
No.
How they goin', kid?
What kind?
Our black friends?
You should have let me do the talking.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
You broke last time.
You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
Man knows what he likes.
CQ what?
I didn't expect anyone.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Do you have any friends, man?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
What d'you say, Elaine?
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Sort a few things out.
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Oh, it just ended, then.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
When did you get in?
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Tell us about it.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
It didn't discourage you, though.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
How far?
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Where is he now?
You sure?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
She's nice lookin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
There is?
I don't get it.
How'd you get in here.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Is he here?
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
You must know Ian.
Thanks.  You, too.
Yes?
He was deaf when he wrote this.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
...I guess I've been all wet.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sure.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
What kind of man *are* you?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Coffee, Ed?
...Probity.
Yeah.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
...I'm Crane.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Yes, sir.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
What happened to them?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
Dr. Green has to see you!
What happened?!
What's that doing here?
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
How many storage areas are there?
Where is that?
We're not supposed to go back there.
Not that big.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
What?
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Where would we find it?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Dr. Green...
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
I don't believe it.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
We're not watching the sea.
He doesn't care.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Are we talking Emmies?
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
Nothing was real.
I have a map.
You take Japanese.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
No...I, er.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
What're we doing here, Truman?
Stay where you are!
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Arrah!
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
How are you, Mother?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
You got it.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
How's it going, Truman?
Poopy day?
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
How'd you find me?
I think you're full of shit.
You know my work?
What?
You told me you had answers.
You've been using me --
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
...thirteen fifty six...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
What? What are you talking about?
You're... quitting?
I wake you?
What are you implying, Scully?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
What did you find?
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
And where are they going with it?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
What do you think it is?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
We've got to keep moving.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
What is it?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
Let me out. Stop the car.
Sing a song of sixpence...
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
...a pocketful of rye.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
What then?
Agent Novak?
With Stargher I saw things...
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
He's mine?
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Already there.
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Intravenous administration complete.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
Catherine!
Any psychiatric medication?
What about narcotics?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Agent Novak.
So?
How is she?
Here he is.
Den leuten.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Drink?
Harry?
Who are you looking for now?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
Holly.
I'm going back home.
Have you seen Calloway?
...is there?
...Headquarters.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
How do you know?
He works in a military hospital.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
How will I know you?
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
...in the morning.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Shall I go over there, sir?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
What's that?
Very popular, sir.
Listen...
You really liked it?
...you know and all that.
Not yet.
Find out?
Coffin?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
I was told that he did not die at once.
...give evidence.
The Roumanian?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Oh, you did.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
No.
...Mr. Martins?
Where are you staying?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Richard - I saw a fin!
Big?
Bonsoir.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Fucking Danny, man...
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What do you think you're doing?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Are they still together?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Who's Linda?
Your father??
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
I want to learn to read it.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
No, I think you shouldn't.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You want a punch in the mouth?
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
An investment banking house.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
How do you reconcile the two?
Who killed Manzetti?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
It was a nine millimeter.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
What is happening?
What about chicken?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Which one were you aiming at?
Open it up.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
You missed on purpose.
And what did you do?
Who's this?
Leary?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Are you out of your mind?!
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
You know each other?
This is a great pleasure.
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
... It's a comfortable place.
Checking out the competition.
How do you know that?
Dollars.
Roberto?  How long?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
What's with the voice?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Why?
I don't have one.
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
No.
Why?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Good night.
You still collect them?
You don't have that one, do you?
Can I come in?
He doesn't like us.
Anybody can have a bad day!
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
A drink to warm up?
I recognize you.
But what brought you to Sicily?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
How can you tell it's a female?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
I'm going back home.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
You'll try again tomorrow?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
... And the new stereo.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Please. Will you help me?
There won't be any need for that sir.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
What!?
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Cool. What's it do?
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I'm sick.
I want him to lock me up.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Don't look at it!
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Why?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
You know Charlie How-Come?
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
What do you do now?
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
On his back, I suppose.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Are you all right?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Kiki?
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
That might depend on where you’re going.
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Who is Friedman?
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can’t satisfy him?
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
What do you suggest?
Crow what?
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
By your Austrian?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
Then find another way.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Who are you?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Who’s the money man?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Carlos De Moraes?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Vous êtes Français?
This car needs petrol.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
I’m sorry...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon’s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he’d have found you before I did.
What’s the date?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Alors?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Why did you kill Friedman?
Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
So why didn’t he?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Who do they think I am?!
Jeanne, stop it!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
I don't know it.  I feel it.
What did the king say?
No, but...
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
We must sound the retreat!
One day you will.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
Do you have a sword?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
And?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Really?
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Is it long and hanging down?
So... what is the message?
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
We... won?!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
They won't come anyway.
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
Beautiful.
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Dorota!
I need help.
Will I still be able to play?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Get your things together, you have to leave!
Have you seen this?
What's happened?
Halina?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
We're recruiting.
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
That's better than yesterday.
I know.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Otherwise what?
What are you reading?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Why didn't you come to me?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
What's all that gunfire?
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
You'd have to organise it up here.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
You don't want to learn.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Wash them again.
She wants to see what you can do.
What did she say?
She wants it to come.
You the owner here?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
You got a bag or somethin?
Twist, you know this guy?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
We cleared 22 here.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
Lonnegan after you, too?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
No signs of trouble?
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
You wanta wait for your share?
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
What's the problem?
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
My end was only one.
It isn't any better.
You doin' anything tonight?
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Hooker!
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
No.
You want a drink or something?
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
What's your next step, Nick?
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
She's got me worrying, too.
What?
Mind if I look around?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
No.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
Then what are you hiding?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Mother!
Another Martini --
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Why... in the heart.
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Dorothy. 
Dead?
I know -- I know --
Shrapnel!
Did you kill her?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
This gun yours?
So would I.
You've been there?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
He's holding out on you.
Get anything?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Could this be him?
What're you doing here?
About three.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
Good morning --
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I'll get some.
I couldn't go near that woman.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
That's my business.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
I can't! I haven't got it!
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
I see.  I see.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
What's that?
So it's you he was after!
You got types?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
She didn't tell me a thing.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
There's one coming.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I never saw that before.
Finished with these?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Is that another Christmas present?
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
He's just been for a walk.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Back to California
What do you mean?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
How long has he been dead?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
I hope you're well.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Nick Charles here?
Well, congratulations.
Bonds, sir?
Home?
Paper.
What?
They shouldn't have been here.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
There's nothing we can do.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Epps!
Stop it!
Then step aside.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
What!?  What!?
You think?
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
SAY IT!
Where you going?
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
X marks the spot.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
A whole lot of nothing.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Wait.
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
What the hell took so long.
We can't just leave him.
Sorry.
What do you think our chances are?
I pick that way.
What do you figure it is?
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
Slip out your M-16.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
To where?
What do we do?
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Wes...?
Can you ride a horse?
Which way do we go!?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Well?
Epps.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Australia.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Woods.
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Iraqis.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
What do you think?
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
Stress category.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
I'm not hungry.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
You know I don't feel well.
What did you get?
Now?
I haven't done anything.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
I'll try.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
THX!
Who?  Who's leaving?
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
I'll report you.  It's....
Right now.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
I knew him.
You don't know that!
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Who the heck're you?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What was-? Why...?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
So what were they doing here?
So cut both.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
How do you know?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Yeah, another round thing.
Glass, what is it?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
You okay?
What is that?
What's the matter?
Alex, please.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Prints?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
You don't fish.
Make an appointment.
Device.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
So what're we looking for?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Captain...
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Yes.
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Nice day, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
But not now.
Monescu!
The fourteenth of May.
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
And you--
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
The same thing.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Yes, I would!
But attractive--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I'm crazy about you!
Then why do you want to go?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
You look beautiful.
Mariette!
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Goodbye...
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
About what?
Right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Good luck to you, Rose.
Who's the best? Say it.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
We're too late.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
The fall alone would kill you.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Hello again.
So, you got a name by the way?
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
It is that simple.
What's this?
And...?
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
I don't know the steps.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Are you nervous?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
No-o!
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
How about a little game later?
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Nice lines--
How about giving me another coat?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
There's soft music--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Well, I'll be--!!!
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
This is a business trip!
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Come in! 
Three Jacks.
That goes two ways.
Care to join us?
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
What?
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
With your dry wit and humor--
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Come on, you...
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
On three?  You call it.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Very cosmopolitan.
Very instructive
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
He's drunk.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
What is it?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Just answer.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Really?  You sure?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
Well hello, Sherm.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
What'd you do that for?
There they are.  No herd though.
I don't like it.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Get down, boy.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Briefly.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Do you feel better now?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Can you arrange a meeting?
I got you covered.
No.
Bourbon. Neat.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Boyfriend?
Nice to run into you again.
And what do you call this?
If I were you -
Why don't we just take these -
... Do you have a gun?
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
... What's Harmsway done?
What's your name?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
I was an attorney!
Damn. It's doing it again.
He brought that up from the wreck.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Oh, no.
I pay my own way.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Why don't you come in for a while?
You okay?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Well, you just have to move further out.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
I'm worn out.
How is the garden doing?
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Did you have your child at home?
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
What are you doing?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
How are you?
To infinity and beyond!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Hey!  Wow!
We're almost there.
Can!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
THAT is Sid!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Right?  Buddy?
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
B-3.
Are you peeking?
Hey!!
MOM!!  MOM!!
That ain't no happy child.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
You are a liar!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No!  No, no, no, no!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
They're getting bigger.
It's Sid!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
This is ludicrous.
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Woody!  Speed up!
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
I like plaits.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
I already lost everything once.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
He's not here.
How much?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
So my wife is lying?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
How long have you known?
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Are you going to?
Is this bad for him?
What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you."
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
What's that mean?
You do?  What else you do?
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
That's a big word for a fisherman.
David --
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You first.
Fine, then we don't have deal.
That's good coke.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
What's your name?
What is the name of your informant?
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Did you tell him?
What?
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
I'll be right after you.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
What's your name?
Where are you going, Diane?
Great.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
What?
Holding hands?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
What? Steady like?
So, what's he like?
What happened?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Are you getting out much?
You take the test?
That's nice.
Good luck, Spud.
Exactly.
You Only Live Twice?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Did he -- you know?
You know.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
It was my fucking television.
Why?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Excellent.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
How's it going with Gail?
Six weeks!
Six weeks and no sex?
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Shuttle en route.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your pain runs deep.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
And that is?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Life is not a dream.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Spock.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
But he does seem familiar?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
Be one with the horse.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
It would appear we are too heavy.
What is this?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
About the ship...
What have I done?



I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
You did break in.
Did he say why?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Beautiful!
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Come on in...
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
Cute.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
User requests are what computers are for.
That was uncalled-for.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Dumont!
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
What's that?
Then...
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Feel what? You okay?
A User?
How?
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
I'm done.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Give me the page.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
She could be telling the truth.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
I thought this look like your work.
He's got it.
My husband is a good man.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
What?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
I can do it!
Natasha?
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
What is it?
Do you still love me?
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Boris and Doris?
Who's your little friend?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Did you get the letter?
Gotten your mail yet?
You got that playing basketball?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
I didn't get any chicken.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Sonny kicks ass.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
'Bout twelve.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Ask me them again. One by one.
I don't remember.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
God, Spiderman looks different.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
You mean she got a bad batch?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You're a whore?
Who?
Who and what is a Drexl?
What did he do to Arlene?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
I think what you did was...
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
Yeah.
You'd really do that?
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Who the fuck are you?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
I'm a married man.
What?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
What's this acting class guy's name?
The zoo.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Say it, goddamn it!
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
You and Robin moved?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
Do you live here?
Wake up, Cole.
No, sir!
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Do you know why you're here, James.
A jail?  Prison?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
It's just a shot to calm you.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
"Never cry wolf!"
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Mason???
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
See -- you can drive after all!
What made you think that?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
Jo...Jose????
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
But you know what's real now?
Nine thirty
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Maybe I do.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
But he's dead.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
Accident.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
No!
Let me get your change.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
No, I've got it.
Yes, I have.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Where you headed?
Nice place you got here.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Have you ever been there before?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Jake.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I shot him.
He was going to take the money.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
I'm a solid man.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
Would you?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Now what can I do for you?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
You love her, but you hate her?
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Yeah, well, me too.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
I want to stay.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
I wasn't doing anything.
Mister!
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I didn't do anything.
No police.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
Hey!  You there!
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Maybe I do.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
What?
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
More or less.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
I wasn't doing anything.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
"Bobby Cooper." What brings you to Superior, Coop?
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Would you?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
How much could you get?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
You own this place?
Great!
How much time?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
I call the sheriff.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
What happens when you lose?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
You love him?
You'd never understand.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
I wanted to talk.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Why?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Why's that?
Where ya goin'?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
"Arkady"
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
One way, or round trip?
Heineken?
Son of a bitch!
Anybody hurt?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
What's the matter?
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Once again please?
I'm listening.
...I can't remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Would you like to try going--
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
I don't know what you're asking?
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
I'm going to go in.
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
No.
How much is it?
I'm sleeping in my room.
In the passenger car?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
He didn't say nothin', huh?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Oh. How long I been here?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Free ones?
Yeah. See?
Yeah, I guess.
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Uh... a little, maybe.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Like I said, I...
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A sign on him?
What'd Ned say?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Yeah, I guess so.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Finish him, Ned.
Better re-load it.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
First one I ever killed.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
I trust you, Bill.
Wha... what f-for?
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Three ways?
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
He hit you?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Shit.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
Yeah?
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Three.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
Did you... did you... ?
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Fuck you.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Well, suppose he does?
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
What are we gonna do?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
What fence? Who?
You watch your mouth.
I'11 be alright.
How are they going to do it?
We'll make it.
How are you, Keaton?
Ready?
What about Redfoot?
What did you say?
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Came from Redfoot.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
I knew him. He would never -
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
How good's your intelligence?
... tell me about this case.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
We thought it was just.
... he wants to testify ...?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Objection, we've...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
They lied.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
She getting good care over there?
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I didn't do too well for you.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
Dr. Gruber ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
What is it?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Continental Casualty...
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
And it's over...?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Thank you.
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Been a long time, huh...?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Uh...the admitting nurse...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I know.  I went ...
She told me.
I just saw her.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
Yes.
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Interesting business.
You don't have to do it for a living.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
How often does this happen?
I want you.
Yes.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Then will you for me?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Thank you again. Good-night.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I don't like it!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Mmmm.
Scottie!
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Scottie, please...!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Why am I here? What happened?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
No.
Why?
And no birds sing.
Have you been here before?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
Why did you jump?
Where?
How do you know?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
Where?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, yes!
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
How do you know? Personal experience?
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well?... what'll you do?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Johnny!
The poor thing....
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
I've told you enough.
Is she pretty?
Just wander.
Mm. Better.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Well...
Jesus.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
This is pathetic.
What did you say?
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
More.
She's got no fucking pulse.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
What is your problem?
What?
Who? What are you talking about?
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
Don't snap at them!
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
Are you solid with that?
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
My god.
That's right.
Is everything okay?
He's too drunk.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
Call 911.
Nobody knows she's here.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Boyd...What have we done?
Regarding what?
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed.
May we have the rings please?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Stop it. I'm sorry.
Charles Moore for instants.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
How much?
Seating problems.
Hello.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Hello.
Where are you?
What about the chairs?
The chairs.
What's the word on the chairs?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah. Sure.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Call the police.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
That's just insecurity.
I don't care for him.
Where did you get that?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
You alright?
Pup corn?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Which couch?
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
How long are you staying?
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
Come down here, you scamp.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
What's the matter with you?
Why the bad temper?
So, Ramona!
Kill him.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Are your parents alive?
Don't say that.
Don't invent stories; go to bed.
It's a very big one.
Yes -- very, very big!
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
How do you feel?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
You actually listen to all those tapes?
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
What happened when he was 17?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
I am impressed.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Don't worry about it, all right?
What the hell's going on?!
What did you do to those people?
You know I am.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
We know you didn't kill those guards.
How did you find out about the toxin?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
That's why I'm asking.
Where's John?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
What can it hurt.
...this is a snappy song....
Mr. President, this is St...
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
<u>IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS</u>.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
It won't hold.
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Why?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
No rain.
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Oh, God...
How's your wife?
What about him?
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.

Hello...?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
My name is Ronald Brean.
What's on your mind?
...Yes.
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Who?
"The Country Is At War." 
...who is this guy...?
We don't need an Act Two.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
Three-o-three...
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Yeah...?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
In the Folk Music Section.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
You can't tell this story.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Don't tune it too good.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
Well, <u>that</u> ain't very butch, is it?
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.

Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
It's tough to rhyme.
What would be true, then.
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...

Oh, hell...
Grand Marnier.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Hey the door was open.
The stock's going to Pluto!
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
...Got a 100 on me, you...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
The FAA announcement.
What brings you out here...
Don't start, alright.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
...thanks Natalie.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
So what's the problem?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
My home number's on the back...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
I don't.
Do you think you're ready?
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Weird and tiny huh?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Hello?
No Jonathan.
Can I give her a message?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
Oh that explains everything.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Can this be stopped?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Yes?
Fireball?
These are good.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
She said, "You know."  That I know.
When...when will she be back?
Who are you?
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Love.
No, I don't.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
You are?
What is it?
It's niiice.
You think he killed her?
Someone's there.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I have to go.
Are you okay?
Then what was it?
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Jody he was lying.
Claire?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
How are you?
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Of what?
Remember how we were?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Oh.
Claire?
Get down!  He'll see.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
Where is she then?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Dressed?
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
There we go.
This is the Feur thing?
Who did?
Keep your voice down.
You know I am.
We walked all night...
I may have seen her on campus.
I don't like this, this...
"You know..."
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Claire, please don't...
I tried to break it off!
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
What's that for?
I know.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
:Would you stop it!
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Who is this...?
I beg your par---
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
I don't want the -
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
To love, you must be able to feel.
There is no one here but the dead.
If that were true, I would not be here.
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Harder...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
What do you see...?
HARDER!
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Stop it.
Hello...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
You look a little green.
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
When aid you get home last night...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
On which planet...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Tell me about your wife...
What didn't you like about her?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You've killed but you're not a killer
Tell me how it happened...
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What is it?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
I don't like sugar
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Well, what do you think?
I want you out now
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
You're late, bro!
Get them together.
What gives, Don Corleone?
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
Sweetheart, what is it?
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
I-I don't have the keys.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
I guess.
Don't write that part.
Funny you should say "peachy."
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Well? What do you think of her?
Where are we going?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
Whatever.
I mean my father.
And then what?
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
That's probably my office.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
Do you trust me, Julie?
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
I'm warning you.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
I do?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
You okay?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
How long?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
This wasn't my idea.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
I wanna live at the beach someday.
Excuse me?
What?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
So, where you off to now?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Hello?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Yes.
Yes.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sandy... What's up?
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
But don't pull that again.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Jim, are you all right?
Well... that, too.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Can you fill me in here?
Thank you.
Know what this is?
Oh, damn!  That's it.
It is?
When we find him, he is mine.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
God in heaven, what is that?!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
You've... done... this... before.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Your private train, sir.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
The first.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Now it's a bomb.
Well?
Hey...!
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
You're chasing a dream.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I can't.
I can't.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
She said lots of thing.s
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Hey, careful there!
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Milking?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Nail it!
I saw him.
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
What's your first move?
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
But not a good tired.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
But why?
Does anybody know I'm here?
How long?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Enjoying your reading?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
What else can you do?
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
I was being foolish?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
John said you're Amish.
What's so funny?
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I will be the judge of that.
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
He's not in this building.
No, you listen. Get out!
Is this where we're going?
I wish dawdie was with us.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Our echo.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
...didn't you?
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
Oh --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...bed.
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Yes -- let's run!
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
...yes.
Um-hmm.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Oh -- Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
...ting the ruby slippers?
Where -- where do we go now?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
... about Dorothy.
...Tin Man!
To Oz?
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
How can I ever thank you enough?
-- Ruined my exit!
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
The King pipeline.
Zukovsky...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
...yes?...
Construction’s not exactly my line.
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Consider me ungrateful.
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
He was my father.
I met you at my father’s funeral.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
I can’t stay.
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
How did you survive?
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
So you killed your father.
Valentin Zukovsky.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
Mother of God.
What is this place?
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It’s what you wanted.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
What about our end?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
What's your theory?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
I'm here, Laurie.
Would you like me to stay?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Jon --
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
What??
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
-- What is it.
What the hell -- ?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
So do I.  So do you.
. . . That was quick.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
What happened?
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
I can fix it.
No comment.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Their real names, please.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
What are you?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
What's that?
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
Where's he headed?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
The Peace conference...
I think I'll hang on to these.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
What's so damn funny?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
Scott.. I -
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Jean... can you?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
He's uptight.
He takes himself seriously.
The intention of registration act -
Who?
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Is that so?
And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
And who might you be?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Miss me?
Does that mean you love me?
Goodbye, darling.
Ready, darling?
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I suppose you're right.
You mean... the laboratory??
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
Home!
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
But what you were doing?
Did you hear that strange music?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
I want that brain.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
You're sure you know what you're doing?
Throw the third switch!
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Original.
All right -- where is she?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
I'm a failure.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
May I see your violin?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
A god?
Right here?
What are you going to do?
Do you think you can sing it?
All right -- give it to him!
Just passing through the night.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
What?
Nor to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
No, not sound.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
How long is it so far?
Three minutes to go!
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

Another fifteen seconds to go.
Drink!
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
