Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Cameron.
Where?
Tons
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I did.
Hopefully.
Hi, Joey.
What's normal?
Can we go now?
As in...
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
It's just a party. Daddy.
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Just sent 'em through.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
That's what I just said
It's a lung cancer issue
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
No, I ' m not.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Away.
You just said
Fifty, and you've got your man.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
Who cares?
I didn't have a choice.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
And why would I do that?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

My father wouldn't approve of that that
Unwelcome.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
No one else knows
Go to the prom with me
No what?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Oh huh
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Right.
Yeah...
Tumescent!
Pirate -- no question.
We'll all go crazy...
I am, Your Eminence
Your life, and that of others!
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The Judgment is ours!
I know.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No?
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
Thousands.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
You'll always be older than me, Father.
What did they say about Granada before today?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Six days ago, yes.
You think I don't know that?
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
I was all of these.
What else do you need?
Somewhere else?
No.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Pouring it out!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
But Chief?  Over this??
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.
Stay with her.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
No, what is it?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
This isn't homicide school.
You got any better ideas?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
My point exactly.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
What's your accomplishment.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Tonight.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
No.  Are you proposing?
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Yes.  Both.
Shut up.
Don't want to film this?
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
That's what it looks like to me.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
What the hell happened?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay, come on down.
Yes?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Yes, I know.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
The antenna has to be replaced.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Well, what is it?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Fine.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Any clue as to what it is?
Thank you very much, Hal.
I want to pick up my car.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Thank you.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
You stay with me...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Yeah, I read the report...
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Shit.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
What'd you do?
Jack, are you okay?
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shut up.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Yeah, old times.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Not bad, not bad.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I'm fucked!
No thank you.
I brought the girl remember?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Good luck..
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
That's what I'm saying.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Leeloo..
Vito Cornelius?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Have you pulled yourself together?
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
This is a police control action..
Uh... not really.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Where have I heard this song before?
Uh..you're welcome.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
...The rain falls...
I love you...
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
I just talked to her.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
Hmm.
And they are?
We can do that.
Right here.
Look, I don't know what this...
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Move it, dirtbag... !
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
I know what you did.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What do you want?
I don't know...
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
What did you do with her body?
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Show me where you buried her.
Where?  Show me where.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Never mind how I found you.
Shut up.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Three, four years.
There's not much illegal.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Child pornography.
Twenty-five.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
I try to be.
He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
My condolences.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I'm afraid I don't...
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
How will I get it to you?
No.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
No.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Okay.
Yes.
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who are you?
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
No, you may not.
I don't want to.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What?
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Is there something we can do?
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Let me talk to you.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
She knew she was gonna die.
About Freddy?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
She doesn't want me around
Who said I...wait, what?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
To take a picture.
Sobering...
Alice...
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
That's the only reason you're alive...
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
So did Dan.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
My baby!
That's their problem.
No shit.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Who?
Yeah...
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
I'd sooner swim!
Yes?
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
I guess.
So?
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
I'm with <u>you!</u>
I...don't know!
What???
The frogmen?
Yes, Griff?
Something wrong?
Why do you say that?
Anything ---
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
We can <u>ram</u> him!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Come where?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
I'll be another!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Toward the Pole!
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Yeah. I know about that.
Tell me.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
You can't buy Wade off.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right!
Shit.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
It's stupid.
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
Yes.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
I want to go home.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
I figured you already heard.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
For a while.
Okay. She's fine.
Said what?
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
What way?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
How?
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
His office. You mean my old office.
She's coming.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Everything you know is from me.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
You think Jack shot him?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Who?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Wade, are you alright?
I'm sorry, honey.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Alice... I...
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
I prefered the terrorists.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Nine.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Stand by.
Copy, Air Force One.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Hold on, Alice.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
You better check it, Unger.
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
If that's the way you want it.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Compute!
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
I mean for Ted.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Don't be too long.
Roger.
Maybe.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Negative.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
All right.  Here.
I don't want to live anymore.
A b...
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Thank you. Cream?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
No.
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
I love you, Elaine.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I will, but Jim won't.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Yeah...
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Show me.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
How the hell do you know that?
Did you learn anything?
Did you talk to him?
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
Why?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Fuck procedure.
Ss-ai!
We can't let him get away.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Whatever gave you that idea?
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
She's right.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
Dead on all channels.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
They're but off!  Do something!
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Aye-firmative.
Let's get these things lit.
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Don't be long, Ellen.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
What about me?
You're really something, ace.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
That's right.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Certainly!
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
A brothel.
Well, what does it matter to you?
You were sublime.
Don't bother!
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Em iram! Em iram!
What?
Eat
Of course.
Oh, leave me alone.
No!
What does she want?
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
No one.
It's killing me.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
What do you mean?
He needs me, ma'am.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
He's doing his best.
In three months! Papa.
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
It's just a trifle, of course.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Yes?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Really?
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Twenty-six.
What is it?
Who told you this, Majesty?
Ah, love again.
I have no idea.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Is she not here?
They say you're in debt.
How many pupils do you have?
How many?
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Bene.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
What is this?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Can I see it?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Whom did they choose?
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
I'm afraid not.
What exactly are you working on?
This is only a vaudeville.
No! No, it's him!
Finish what?
Also identical?
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
You go fast!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
I regret it is not too familiar.
And do they believe it?
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes?
Italian?
Exactly.
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
He said 'Jack'.
What happened to them?
Yes, sir.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Yes?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I dream of death mostly.
That's not really a very proper question.
Will you come with me?
Will you think about it?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Charming.
Pull over.
Jack is dead!
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
What?
David, let's go now.
David, don't lose control.
No.
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
You could have told them!
I was having a nightmare.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
I assume full responsibility.
Nice to see you.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I heard that.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Yeah.
It's circling us.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Not far enough. Come on.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
What do you think?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Hello.
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
I beg your pardon?
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Yes - sure—
Matt?
Yeah.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Yeah.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
That's very simple. I was home.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
You understand?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Get out, get out!
You don't have to do nothing.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Now?
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
I haven't any.
Yes, sir.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
If he can do it, yes.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Matt, come here!
Oh, is that so?
With what?
I tell you, I saw them!
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
All right, dear.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
He was here?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
Yes.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
... Will Perry ...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Two.
Exactly.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Yeah.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
That's it.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
I'm thinking...
Strategically.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
Ho-yah!
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
So we got a plan?
I figure.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Don't care.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
They're making him a hero now.
So what was he?
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
What?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Sparkling rocks?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
What?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
I'm not hanged yet.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Fair enough.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Thank you.
I guess so.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I demand action.
Can't you tell me anything?
Vengeance.
Stop it. I'm...
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Eight?
Yes.
What do you want, Courtney?
You and...Luis?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Alright.
Evelyn?
I don't want to talk about it.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
It's not.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I have to return some videotapes.
No, he doesn't.
There was no ad in the Times.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
No, you...didn't?
Jesus lives, Luis.
Maybe it's just the light.
What?
Leaving what?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Two at nine? Perfect.
See you then.
Just...say...no.
Yes, sir.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Oh no. I have no plans.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
You didn't give them a name.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
No, not really.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
What's that?
Sorry. 
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Jean-I'm not-
What do you think I do?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Hello 
You're at Paul Owen s.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
No.
People just...disappear.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
That's not the information I've received.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Not a big music fan, eh?
And?
Marcus?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Where was Marcus?
I'm hungry.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
I've been great. And you?
Yeah, well, you're late.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, Owen.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
I can paint anywhere.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Milo! What about --?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
I know, I know.
Isn't that -- extreme?
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Different?
What?
Just shut up?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Right... What's that mean again?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
Would you like a Coke or something?
You're making me young again.
Well -- you sent for me.
Were the flags for Teddy?
The wrong place?
You look a little tired.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
You do?
Cool.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
The Day Care?
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
You mean -- break in?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Uh. Not exactly.
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
What?!
I met this girl.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Where is he?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Sak-i it to me!
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Hey, how are you?
Smashing!
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me?
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Not now, Austin.
Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
Yes.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Behave!
Danger's my middle name.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Is it one of ours?
What are you saying, son?
Silence!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
My son?
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Dr. Evil?
Sea bass.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Yeah. What?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
He's asleep.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Seriously?
... bottle ...
... love ...
... love ...
Three days.
So I'm still ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
I have an appointment.
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Then who wins?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
The Institute ... the funding ...
To find out who killed my husband.
Next assignment?
Thanks, Valentine ...
Too many cooks --
'Our revels now are ended.'
Ring?
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Whereas you are.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
How on earth can you tell?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Barely.
I thought you didn't.
You lied.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
You're saying I have no choice.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I see.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
I shall need a small plane.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
How did you guess?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Anyone particular in mind?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Where?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
I think so, thank you so much ...
Perish the thought.
If you say so.
Did I? My mistake.
Ugh ...
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
What is this person's story here?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
She's mine!
I've tried to change her mind.
Keep me informed.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
You're going to have a bachelor party?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I am committed. I love you.
A real turd.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Milt?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
All right, who serves?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Rick!
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
This isn't right.
So long, Father.
About what?
Got me.
Very.
Who's your friend?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Who?
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Yeah...
Stevie... I...
Who asked you?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- Never mind.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Thanks for the insight.
You're selling dad's boat?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
How's it going?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Then why did you quit?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Leave Stephen out of this --
Hi.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Who's doing this?
Then who --
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Glass?
No it couldn't.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
And the putty around the door?
What reason?
Are you going public with this?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah? Airtight?
No.
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
No need to be modest, Brian.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there, goddamn it!
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Did he tell you how we finally met?
And the world -- the whole world.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Investigator Rimgale.
Investigator...
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
You mean you could use it.
I'm a Catholic.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Me?
I forgive you.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
I'm on it.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Yeah!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Who are you revolting against?
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
Must be the pressure.
And this is Manray.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
We was coming to see you.
EUREKA!!
To what?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I've never been given a fair shot.
Go on.  Good so far.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Manray!
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
You getting cold feet?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
Give me the gun.
You sound like the media.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I can't go all the way down south.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Oh her.
She hates dem.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
...no, she didn't...
...I heard different, thought that was...
Enough.
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
No, before my time.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Why don't you answer?
That is none of your business.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
I never was more in earnest.
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
It must have been some other gate.
The coward!
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Have you had one?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
It is my only object.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Agreed.
Then you must get it.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Good night, my little darling.
Yes, papa.
Is he all right, papa?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Who?
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
They're dead, aren't they?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
He's lying.
I didn't shoot West --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Do I?
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Put it down!
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
But you didn't.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Well?
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
And the problem is you only got three.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Who killed Pike?
Home, I'm done.
What the hell are you talking about --
That's horseshit and you know it.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
What are you talking about?
You're drunk --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
You and the Colonel go back.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
What happened next?
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
They got their stories straight.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You wanted to get the truth.
Good, just making sure.
Get in.
Right back where we started.
Want company?
Oh, you remember now --
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
We've been making progress, I see.
What?
Wait --
Childs.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
We're not going anywhere.
Bullshit --
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
It truly is.
I brought it.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
I see. I thank you for your time.
I know.
That's terrible.
Please?
Really?
Did you do any of that?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Okay.
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I will.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Story of my life.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
Hello.
Because he's dying.
Yes.
That's because most of it never happened.
We rented a car.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. But that's a different...
Yes?
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
We'll stop then.
Name it.
Leave him!
No I haven't.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
No. It is too judgmental.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Good night.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
Yes.
What's wrong?
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
You don't understand anything.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
So you're just going to be vindictive
What? No you're not..
It's none of your business.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
But, you know, so what?
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You don't understand you either.
You don't have to say anything
Thank Christ for that.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Okay. Promise?
It's more like a date.
Tell me about it.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Oh, she older than that.
Can I come in?
I do. God's truth. I do.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Let go...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
In my house, you watch that lip...
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Uh-uh.
You drink whiskey?
I ain't in a hurry.
Anything.
By myself?
Looks like you know a song.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
What I love.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Now, hold up.
Uh-huh.
Naw!
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Or what?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Not like that.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Yes'sir.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
Rae!
Hey.
Yeah, I do.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Get rid of it.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
-- I should tear your head off.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Not a prayer.
No.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What does Charlie mean?
I wasn't expecting you.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Sure.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
San is an honorable title.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Big enough.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I don't know.
Yes...
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
You could fake it.
No one's keeping him here.
I'm taking you back.
What?
He killed a police officer.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
The families who control the casinos?
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
I am?
Also extraordinary things.
You're androids.
Dr. Tyrell?
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
Yeah.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
It's okay.  Forget it.
My pleasure.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
I don't know nothing about it.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You mean the snake.
I bet I would.
Of course not.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
It would be my child.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Yeah.
Like?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
You mean a woman?
What?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Thirteen.
Discreetly.
Sorry.
What one?
Of course.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Hi.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Just better.
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
Young man, stop right there!
What?!
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Oh, that's nice.
Yes, I'm right?
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
What is it?!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Oh, I'm sure it will!
A wife?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Of course.
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
What?!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Wow.
That's boring!
Yeah.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Do I look crazy?
No way.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
No, son. A pitcher.
Why?
Blow out the candles!
Shit is a French word?
Merci!
I promise. Is that all?
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Really?  Since when?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Almost all of them.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
Bye, Adam!
How old do I look?
The sky!!!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Good!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
I'll be all right.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Yes, dear!
To go up.
How could you?! This is just like home!
What?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
What shall we call him?
You bet.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Yes...
Mutants?!
No.
We do?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
--and we will--
Amen.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
What's that supposed to mean?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
We'll find him.
Then what?
What?!
Where?!
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
You did? A human ear?
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes?
Okay.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Yes sir.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Well.
Then you got undressed.
I, I don't know.
Yes.
See my nipples?
No, please. I won't.
Yes, I like you.
I, uh.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Who's it, you mean.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Frank is coming?
I sure don't hate you.
I'm doing it.
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
I want you to stay with me.
No.  Hi baby.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don? Where is he?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Those are my breasts.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Am I bothering you?
Terrible boring.
Maybe so.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
He got a little jealous.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
No.
Okay. Great!
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Stop it Mike.
Let's do him right here.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
I-I'll tip her.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Connor, is that you?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
BLAME...
We paid attention in school.
Right.
How many?
He got beat up by a girl.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Aye.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
He's a good man.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
No way they could have seen it?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Who were the victims?
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Y-Yes my son.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You know them personally?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Fuck you Vincenzo.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
That sets it off.
Hang on a second.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
Where's the other stocker?
We know there's another stocker.
Like he meant it.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Hi.
You were asleep.
If you say so.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Don't panic, Anthony.
That's not correct.
How much?
Shut up!
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Who's Mr. Henry?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
He seems pretty good.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Eleven fifteen.
As a person?
Roger.
Nobody move!
I'll get him.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Oh, I'd say about --
He stole a tractor.
Dignan, I --
What?
Dignan, I --
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
It feels good.
That sounds like Dignan.
Why'd you want to help us?
Yeah. He said that.
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You think I'm improving?
Sixty days?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
I didn't do anything.
Bob! Get back in position!
I don't know about that.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Good question.
I warned you, Dignan.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
He electrocuted someone?
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
He wouldn't move.
It's registered in my mother's name.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Come on, Dignan.
Watch me.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Anthony. Bad news.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
That's OK.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Run. Run. Let's go.
What's that?
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Well, I think --
Well, I left some money in there.
No, my friend knows her.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Good to know you, John.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Will it track back to us?
Anything else?
One last push. One.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
...this is Conklin's computer.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Don't know.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
The sooner the better.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
Then what?
Sorry. Old habits.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Conklin.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
Conklin up front.
No. There's nothing new.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
He was at the campground yesterday.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
You never worked Berlin...
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Who's this?
Me? Four years.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
If you say so.
You mean, did I want a date?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
And what about you, anything?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
I don't want to leave.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
We cannot defeat this --
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He will. I know he will.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Fourteen? --
I rest.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
How many?
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Let her speak.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
You scare me.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
How do you know this?
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
...I wouldn't know.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I am trying.
Exactly.
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What is it?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Okay.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
What? What could he do?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Weirder than this?
Yes.
But I... I need those books.
I thought you were a December baby.
What?
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Damn. Your dad did this?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
What do you want to know, Evan?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I walk differently?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Why's that?
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Which is?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
...yes.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Gee, thanks friend.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Huh?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
You're such a retard!
I came with Captain Renault.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Yes, Monsieur.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I won't.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, my check, please.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Suppose we do.
Practically no one.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
I will.
We said "no questions."
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
But what about us?
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Be careful.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Not at all.
My office.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Thank you.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Good evening, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
How about New York?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
You think of everything, don't you?
Our expenses?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Hello Ugarte.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
No.
Then don't have a drink.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yes, boss.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Why do they have to die for me?
They're on autopilot.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Okay.  Sure.
They're harder to do than they look.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
You can't go now.
You want to.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I thought you might have.
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
Great.  Really.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
So did I.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
Don't you even think about it.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What about the sender?
What's going on down there?
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
To Wilson.
Hallelujah.
What?
No sweat.
Permission granted.
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Really?
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
Hi...
I can't go nowhere.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
She looks after other people's children.
Someone not from Maine.
Is that soon?
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Right.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
We heard that one already, Homer.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
No trouble.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
What view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
Know who I am, Jake?
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
It's not true.
After you cut her loose.
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
I told you, use less powder.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Well, this is just fucking great...
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You sure?
Eight A.M. flight.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
I have a good crew.
I can't do that.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I need you to stake me.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Don't worry about it.
What?
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Then shut up.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What?
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Jake? Customs?
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Then who's the Banker?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's the tension.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
I don't know anything about it.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I'm working on that soccer story.
South African women are very sporty.
Who was he?
Not particularly.
I. sold the car.
I've got a job.
I'm on at nine.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Leave it.
You will?
You were talking in your sleep.
Never. Why do you ask?
There was a message, wasn't there?
I hate public transport.
Well, thank you anyway.
Absolutely not.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
It won't.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
What about my neck?
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Have I?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Good call. Help yourself.
I'll tell you later.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Jack.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
We do. 
No.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Key?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
No.
And I saw that I was alone.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
That is correct.
Yes, well...
...nine seconds...
I have no proof that it was false data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I'll check it.
Yes, Doolittle.
Any planets?
What?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
I hereby name this star Fred.
Who cares?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
No kidding?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Talk to the bomb.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
What the hell are you doing?
None of your business.
No.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
What?  Where're we going?
No way.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
Mommy, where are you?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Logan Cale.
Too early to tell.
Bent?
That would be appropriate, yes.
Yes on all counts.
The other ones?
And you still think you can do something to change that.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
Oh?
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Straight.
What?
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
How long you and me known each other?
Where?
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
What if he's on the level?
Tell everybody hey.
Max--
But there's another side--
I'm the victim here.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Got any KISS?
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Believe it.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Bye.
You got in the car, didn't you?
What's in Sandusky?
One more time in English.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Oh, yeah...?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
Uhh... nothing.
A bustier?
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
What?
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Like a spear.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Donnie! Give it back!
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
I am so sorry.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
And you'd never been there before?
Why?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Why? Is this about the book?
The Lifeline is divided that way.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I don't own a television.
Yes.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yes.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
You've done it again?
God exists because you're horny.
Where are we going?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Where is he, Donald?
Congratulations.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frank?
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Donnie? You're a dick.
It is a big deal.
Yep.
I guess they made him do it.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
We was robbed.
We all do. Now let's go.
You heard me. Where is it?
Then it must be Wednesday.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Uh, Gladys?
Harold!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
"My dear"...
"My President"...
"My"...
But you're my father -
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
Yankee Poodle.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
What do I get?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
Go ahead.
I still like UPSTART the best.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
I've always thought that myself.
I'll join you shortly.
No, I think a whiskey.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
And here are my mother and father.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
What do you mean?
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Everything will be seen to.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
And what was that, John?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
I am very pleased to meet you.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Righteousness...
Of course! What did you think?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, John?
There is one more thing, John. Here.
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Yes.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
And I thought you said it was something special...
And the week before that?
Who?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Goodbye, Aud...
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No... no...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
I'm sure it's lovely.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
I didn't mean to!
Well... no...
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Find it... AND cross it!
Very deep... usually...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Row! Row! Row!
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Well, come on!
Just say something cheerful.
I was sitting there.
We haven't got a spare place.
What do we have to do?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
That's it!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
That's right.
I know, Dad.
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
You liar!
Me too.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mum.
Say hi to Naomi.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Okay, I guess.
Okay, I guess.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Yeah, I got it.
I don't know what that means.
That's okay.
I like to read.
Sort of, um...
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I don't know.
That's scary sounding.
Yes.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
I want to have a baby.
Would you get me another, Joely?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
I love it!
Yeah.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Not yet. Not married.
I remember that speech really well.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Hi.
I'm Joel.
Yeah, like that.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Okay.
Um, no.
Oh.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I don't know.
Hey, Joel --
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I just walked in.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Hi.
I miss you.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
'kay.
We haven't checked.
That's a good one.
What?
Hi.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Jesus.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Your ranch?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
No, thank you.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
It is not.
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
What happened?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Oh God...
He's crashing...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
How do you know all this?
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Justin.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Justin. I won't let you die.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
The Core...!
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
I don't know...
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
Don't... don't do this...
Watch me.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What makes you think I'll miss?
NOOO!
What is that?
Yes, sir.
Starck...
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Radiation interference?
Keep your eyes open.
Carbon dioxide?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
What is it, Starck?
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
They're explosive charges.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
There's no one here.
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
We're losing atmosphere...
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
How?
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
It means nothing.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm worried about you.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Youthful high spirits.
Well maybe you should date him.
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Got it, teach.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
So are you!
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Please tell me you go silent too.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Blockhead started it!
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Never better.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What...?  Oh.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Are you kidding?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Hilarious.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Ben did this.
I understand the business reasons.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
Just find him.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Arnold. What's happening?
Don't worry about it.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
It's the first door on your left!
Later.
No. I want my money back right now.
Manager!!
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
What? Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
She's in my biology class.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Yeah?
Damone! You come here?
Sensitive -- what is that?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I thought he was out of town.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
It was nice.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
No. But it's a nice idea.
No.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
That little prick.
What do you want?
He's not coming.
Yeah, like maybe never.
What class?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
I don't know. I guess so.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Do you really have to go?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naw! Not a major.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Hell, no!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
My heart!
You whore!
No, no. Don't leave me!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Not much. Why?
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
They were all veterans.
It's gone too far.
Where'd you get this?
Some of what?
Right!
Yes!
Never missed a plane yet.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
I don't know what you're talking about!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
They'll be back.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
We're lucky to be alive.
Hey!
Easy.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
Follow me.
Shit!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Fuck you too.
What?
Why don't you go check it out?
My truck.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
But --
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
Sure.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He only shot you once.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
What?
Fully.
Covered.
Seven.
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Get outta here.
Whoa!
Oh? And what's that?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Gimme the keys.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
She's not very nice, is she?
Wait God-dammit!
Not without you!!!
GO-GO-GO!!
We all have to be strong, right?
Oh...
Um, well...
I'm not lying.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Who's this?
I'd like nothing better.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
But I'll never win that.
Thank you.
Thanks, Dad.
He's a socialist, then?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Are you really serious? About acting?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Don't touch me.
Harry.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
What happened to him?
Yeah.
What?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
I took the early rounds.
And?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
What's that?
I know. Don't tell anyone.
Who?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
How did I look?
Just a little way.
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Yes, Ma.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Mama, what's...
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Then why did you bring them?
I'll be back.
I will, I promise.
Don't I know you?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
No! No!
Yeah?
What?
Yes.
Then why weep for him?
The music? Or the fire?
You speak.
Kill me and have done with it.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
A brain. Extremities.
And you look so lovely.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
So have I
Is he not back yet?
Aren't you?
Not as weak as I.
Your decision. For us.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Aye, Captain.
Oh God.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Thank you, Henry.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
The strain was evident.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Sure.
Un-hunh.
You okay?
You're right. It makes no sense.
Artist.
I don't know.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Good point.
Absolutely.
I'll go take a look.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Here we go.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
I'll spot you five points.
Where's Ned?
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
I love you.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Rocky Road.
I got to.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
I'm exhausted.
I have no idea.
He's running the show.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
My wife.
You won't let him touch her?
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Pass.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Kate, Scott?
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Okay.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Later.
-- you got your shower --
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Knock yourself out.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
He signaled the Ranger.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Seth, if you were me --
This ain't the time.
I did?
We are?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
Where are you right now?
Yeah.
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Thank you, ensign.
That's what I hear.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
What'd you find, Kathy?
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Which is guy-speak for...
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What?
Well, now I feel so much better.
Thanks, Wick.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
I don't know...
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Should I be afraid?
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Go in there. Talk to her.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Only one way to find out.
You must have quite some harem.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Yeah, well...
Oh, just some insurance guy.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
And you're beautiful...
Call me Charlie.
So have dinner with me tonight.
What?
Well, I think you're cute.
I don't think so.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Have them sealed off.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
We know.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
You're standing on it.
Why do you need that?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Makes us look more American.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Thanks.
Open.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Yes. Good was done this .....
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Alex? Where are you going?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Down there.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
What's  your name, son?
It's okay. Listen-
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Yes Commander?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
We're getting major structural damage.
There is no weather in space.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Never mind, Fred....
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
It's ... incredible.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Not a clue. You?
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Don't be ridiculous.
Turn on the translation circuit.
What the hell are you talking about?
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Catch me later, okay?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
NO, Thank God he has not.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
But there it is!...
But...Why?
Wh... Where are we?
Pedal to the metal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
They always say that.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
And a French alliance?
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
While they're strung out?
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Yes, I believe so.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
Gag on your own invention, then.
What's the difference?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
I... they look both the same.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
But not more than your comfort.
George, I'm sorry.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Or, 'civilized'.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Just because they are born?
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Calm down, Bear...
You're right.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
You can talk to me.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
That's all.
What money?
I'll find it.
Gimme an hour.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
What three hundred grand?
Look at me, Ray.
That's correct. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
He owes me money.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Not yet. I just started.
Where you been, Harry?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
That's right. As a matter of fact...
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Maybe a few times I have.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
He died.
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Like this?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
How much is the wife offered?
...That's what we finally decided.
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Don't go out of your way.
There a part in it for you?
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
Depends, who pays?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You bet.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm thinking about producing.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Harry -–
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
And after all, you have such morals.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Why not.
What're you crazy?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Oh yeah.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Smugglers maybe.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
Hard to say.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Could be meant as a warning.
If they knew what they were carrying.
How do you mean?
I don't know what you're talking about?
You smashed it!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
If money can buy what he wants.
There's a charming thought.
Right.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Because of the gold.
It's my pen name.
Yeah. Thanks.
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
The guy. He just came this way.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
What?
Wish I could say the same.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
That much I think we've already established.
Epps, over.
Maybe it was more than that.
We hit land.
Looks like it's adrift.
How's that?
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Who?
How should I know?
Yeah, I heard about that.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
I just buzzed him in.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Jesus...
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Why?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Good.
Just look at them!
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Or maybe not.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Which loser?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
We should follow him home.
Gross!
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
As always.
I don't believe you.
Where?
No way... when?
You cunt!
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Yeah, thanks.
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
Great...
I said "great"...
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
That's okay...
Tell me what?
That tape sucked, by the way!
You don't know what you're talking about.
I did too!
Indian records?
Watch my stuff.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
PLEASE? We have to!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
Shh!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Really?
Why?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
I had to see you.
Can you at least let me in?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Right.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
That slut!
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Yes?
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
But overall, you're pleased?
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Then why do you stay?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
We have hunted since childhood.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Have you got that in writing? 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
Might be exciting for you.
You mean nobody died?
What did I do?
I can try.
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
What happened to them?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Thank you, Samuel.
I do, actually; very much.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Four should do it.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Okay, that's no problem.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
I don't know what to do anymore.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
I hate Jello.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
No, I just thought --
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Thanks.  What's in there?
I told you, I ...
That's it.  Get out.
Out!
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
I think it's the food of the future.
What is it?
Here are tonight's calls.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
You could say that.
Why do you want to see it?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
What do you mean "bad?"
Gozer.
That appears to be the case.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What do we do now?
What do I say?
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
It's not good, Pete.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
And the seas would boil ...
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
If I may be so bold...
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
What are you talking about?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
That's difficult to say, general.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
You flatter me, Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now!
On what charge?
I'm serious.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Yes, Caesar.
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
I'll nose around...
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
My troops don't make policy.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
I can see that...
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
Chain him.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I want nothing to do with the arena.
No.
I just want to tell you something.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
You sure you really want to?
You do?
Get out of here.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Because -- I am.
Elaine -- I love you.
You've got to tell me what she said.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Mr. McQuire.
Yes, sir.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
I am going to call the police now.
I'm in the bathroom.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
What?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
It's in the main ballroom.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
What?
No. 
What?
What for?
What do you drink?
I'm very neurotic.
Sit down.
Right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes, I have --
Why is it?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Get away from that door.
A drink? Of course.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
What?
You're welcome.
INADEQUATE!
Don't you?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What one.
What novel did you read.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Calm down, Benjamin.
No we don't.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Is it?
No.
Are you shocked?
Not particularly.
Why are you asking me all this?
Art.
I don't think we were the first.
There's nothing to tell.
Are you?
You don't have to say that.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Where is Elaine?
Sir?
Very good, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
What?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
No -- they don't.
About an hour ago.
What about it?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
No.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Ben, can I say something to you?
I'd like to hear it.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin Braddock.
Splendid!
The pearls are in her room.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
I could take care of her.
That.
No -- why? -- should I?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
You're very funny --
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Would you like to make a man happy?
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
How tired you are!
So alone.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
Oh -- 
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Why do you think --
Yes -- I will be on the train.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
All of that at once, Baron?
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I did not ask your advice.
Don't do that. 
No -- letters to two-eighty.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Nobody, Doctor.
The Grand Hotel.
What, Doctor?
Stay where you are.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh -- what -- what -- 
Money!
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover...
You pay me.
Movies?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Hello!
Exactly.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
You've decided against the merger?
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Such nonsense.
I could not think of not accepting.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
You are late. Hurry.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
Bobo, no, I --
And if you do it wrong?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Fine.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
These machines -- They're in here.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
But what's wrong?
I'll get you a check.
It's not your fault.
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Fair enough.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
Get off the grift, Roy.
That's right.
I pay my debts.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Uh-huh.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
A future. The only future I've got.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Are you sure?
All? It ain't bad.
You called the doctor, huh?
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
What happened to Cole?
Where?
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
What?
I'm happy the way I am.
Yes?
Gun?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Only the real stiffs.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
Doesn't look good.
No shit.
Checking out your place.
And miss the big game?  No way.
You sure?
You're so predictable.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Nothing.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Yes.
I was trying to protect you from this...
John...
You stole it?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I came to see you.
Then you come out here.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
It's always John.
It's not going to happen.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Michael Meyers.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
You're unbelievable.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Why?  You interested?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
The voice man!  He's here!
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
An old friend.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Stay away, Sam.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
No!!!
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Oh, shit.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
First Nagasaki--now this.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Really?
Sorry.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You.
You're an imbecile.
Everybody thinks that.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
They were enemies.  We were at war.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
You actually sold insurance!
I've considered that.
You're making a joke.
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!  Out!
Thank God!
As a matter of fact--
Are you--do you--
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
Everybody says he was so brave.
They were in the same creative writing class.
What's good about that?
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Uck.
Sir?
Sir?
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Who was it?
What's this?
Nothing.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
I don't want to fight you.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Situation.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Ram it up your ass!
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
No.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
I don't think so.
Hope.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Rifle?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Like what?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
I plan to live one hundred years!
What a handsome word.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
He's dead, you know.
Hello, Mother.
Oh dear.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
I've got to run!
I've literally got to run!
I came back.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
I was going to ask.
Are you've seen it work cures?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
You were wrong, you quack!
Yes.
You haven't heard me yet.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I'm utterly satisfied.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
I've enjoyed being man.
It's trash now, like mine.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
I'll kill myself.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Stay home tonight!
I didn't know that.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Who have you been talking to?
That man is your father.
He can hardly talk.
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Keeps fairies away!
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Far as I know.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
You figure!
A what?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
Take plenty of cigars.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
That's the XKE.
Meaning?
He's not your son.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Penelope!  We're late!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
No.
But is she, has...
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Are you going to stiff me?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Sam?
Do you know where she lives?
Tod might know.
Something like that. How much do you make?
What rate?
You don't understand shit.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
No.
But it's all you do.
Not very.
What do you care about?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
No, please go on.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Who's paying you?
Yeah.
Where is she?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Do you think she's safe?
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Like what?
I just heard. Who is he?
That's not true, Mr...?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where!
Let's go.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
What exactly do you have in mind?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
You're taking a big chance.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Oh, I don't have one.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Hello.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Wait here.
Not very.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
Harold Chasen.
It's very interesting.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Promise?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
What do you mean?
Because they are all the same.
Is he all right?
Well, I don't...
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Yes. It's almost there.
Yes.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
What was that?
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Yes. They're old friends.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Here.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
At a funeral.
I don't care what people say.
Perhaps it is.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Ah, yes.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I go to funerals.
No.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Thank you, Uncle.
Yes.
Eh?
Souvenirs?
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
What's the matter with her?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
WHY?
What are you talking...
Then why are you here?
The Cenobites.
Is he serious??
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
No. It was red. Bright red.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
You call that thing a cigar??
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Father's back?  Still angry?
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not from you.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
Doesn't sounds like him.
What?
Two steps back, please.
Sure.
Julia's my second wife.
You did this before, right?
To a man called Frank Cotton?
No. That wasn't the deal.
It's important.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Tell me who you are.
Keep your voice down.
I said no.
Hi. I got soaked.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Where's Daddy?
I saw everything.
So what's the argument?
I cut myself.
So damn stupid.
Are you O.K.?
Can I get you anything?
Sure.
O.K.
O.K.
Kirsty.
You want something to drink?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
That's right.
Maybe I will.
Wait a moment --
Daddy?
YOU'D like my room.
O.K.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I love you, honey.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
No. It's all over.
So lie down.
I thought we'd lost you.
It's late.
If there's a train.
We walk.
She's so damn... English.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
What happened to you?
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
What do you mean, "what?"
Ehh.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Suck my ass.
You're not even coming?
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
We're getting that anyway.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
I have all of the others.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Nothing.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
What do you mean, four more?
Fine.  That's great.
Hey Rob.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
You look upset.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Think about it, Rob.
I should be so lucky.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
It was kind of funny.
That bad, eh?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Pig died.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Want to know what, exactly?
I'm alright.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
WHAT?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
I'm going to talk to you.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Would you marry me if I was?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Hey.  It's Liz.
It's a crematorium.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough of what?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
I'm sure it isn't.
That way.  You?
Everything all right?
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Well call her mother.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Sixty.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
Nice.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Go to hell.
Claymore.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Basil the II.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Tradition.
Where?
Go home.
Why are you here?
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
Will I see you again?
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
Thanks.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Never take up poker, Detective.
All I need is for you to check the name.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
Pheasant.
You know me home.  Me name.
You are the same?
It is less.
You will live.  Survive.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
Me arm hurts.
Go to hell.
Muy Bien!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
I'll be back when I can.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Finish yours?
So sure?
You seem to understand a great deal.
It can be different.  It must be.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Figure she's with him?
You'd think he'd had practice.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
How many came?
He knows I'm here.  How?
Head still secure to the neck.
What are you doing here?
You're insane.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
MACLEOD!
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
We were very close.
When may I expect the cleaners?
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I notice you still remember it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
You bet I've got a better offer.
Listen, Walter --
You -- you --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
What's his line?
What for?
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
I know, but --
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Where's some paper?
Okay, Walter. 
Where's Butch?
I'm finished.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Thanks.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Walter!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
What's that -- what's that?
You know you did!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You got plenty of money?
They can't do that to me!
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
I think it is.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Yeah. But I --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Throw him out, Frank.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I was just going to!
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
And up a dime.
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Huh?
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
That man there!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Very simple, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Ssh!
Shut up, you!
Forty dollars.
Who do you think!
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
A very fine-looking women.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Why?
But Grandpa, you said...
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Who told you that?
Yes.
I only know one.
Sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
Would.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
...and six...
The sodding water table.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
What's that?
You taste it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Out.
There, there, my baby.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
I know you mean well.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Really, that's a long time.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
What?
Come on.
You're welcome.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Now, what makes you think that?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
I don't.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
OK, Boss.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
What's that?
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
He won't move.
Yeah, showtime for what?
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Lock the fucking doors.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
I gotta open the gate.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Hmmmmm.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Sleeping.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Huh?
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Sorry.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Let's go see.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Who's your Daddy!
Well, go get her.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
I pray to God there is.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Gabrielle.
French?
Oui.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
When you were a little French girl?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Not in front of the boy.
Stop. Get away.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Hi. It's Nathan.
God, you're beautiful.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
And I think I'm going to.
Ready!
With pleasure.
Shut up, you.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
You've got to respect that.
Where?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
We are animals after all.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Do you?
Terrific. Can't wait!
That's very funny.
He looks perfectly fine.
What?
All right.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
No.
That's great.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
How come?
That was wonderful!
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Ugnh.
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Got it.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
Yes... Derek.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
It's open...  What'll you have?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
No, I'm fine.
I've never been to Louisville.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Do we need words?
Thank you.
All I want's the money.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
It's possible.
Cash.
I got drunk.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
A thousand.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
I told you. I got drunk.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Now, when did you adopt me?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Where do I sign?
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
You hustlin' me?
How're the hands?
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Want some free advice?
You well-heeled, partner?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
I feel tight -- but good.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Give me a drink, will ya?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
I asked around.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Okay?
Yeah, sure has.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Hi.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Yes.
Fine, thanks.
Thanks. I will.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
Okay. So what's your name today?
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
I love you.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Oh, I don't know.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
That's right.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Game's over, Eddie.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
Yes.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
Okay.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
Sure ... fine.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Yes.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
I don't see anything.
All their lines were busy.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I... 
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
Why, yes.
You have to leave the White House.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
David, don't...
He's a good man.
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
What's the bad news?
It's perfect the line is busy?
You can do that?
He wasn't the President then.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
I'm making a mess.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Then God help us.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Then find them.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
He's doing a good job.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
What?
Butt-munch.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
You know me...
No. Exotic.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
We should leave too.
Above American soil?
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
And I am his.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Papers, sir. Got it here.
You've got it!
Yes. My treat.
Arghhh! Oh!
What?
That was our assessment as well.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Yes?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
We're through!
Yes?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
I usually don't.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Find something?
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
What?
You said go between them!
You had it? You didn't trust me!
No?
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
Out!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Junior!
He was actually there? You saw him?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Will you take it easy!
She talks in her sleep.
Head for the fireplace!
What?
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
I know, Dad!
Junior?! Dad...
Ready.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
You think so?
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Just a statue.
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
The old man saw it in a dream.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
First of all -- don't panic!
What?!
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Maybe he likes older women.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
A what?!
I'm going down.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You've got to go to sleep now.
Yes.
Yes, they believe you.
No... they won't kill me.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
Willie, come on!
Who's you?
Don't do that.
I just got here.
Where are we?
Why don't we go home?
Yeah?
No.
What are you doing in my head, Al?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Yep.
You're gonna explain.
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Oh...Gooood!
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
No. Don't tell the guards.
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You gotta help.
Find You?
We have to get out of here.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Take a left and your next right.
Who did?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
We'll change your appearance.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
The beach.
You eat it.
Wait.
Where are you staying?
No...you idiot!
...Rene...
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
I made it work.
The beautiful one.
You have no taste.
Are you serious?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What am I supposed to do?
That's good. It's not better. Where?
That's not funny.
What do I do?
Probably.
Come on.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
While he makes the run.
...Shit! It's just money.
What exactly?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Looks like you can have all you want.
About what?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
It'll remind me of you.
Oh, I can't.
I insist.
In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
He's not an ordinary man.
We insist.
That name's familiar.
What?
Oh.
Do what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
I will?
What?
A little voice in my head.
Just give me the keys.
Sir?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
No. No one to speak of.
Do what?
I just work for the travel firm.
It's not apparent.
I am sort of scattered.
You talk to yourself.
You did.
You're doing...Okay.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Is that Ryuji?
How often they come here?
You seemed interesting.
What do you mean?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You did.
Oh sure.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Beats me.
Get us one.
You've  been there?
Can you?
I can't fly it.
Why?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
If he was able, what would he say.
I told you, I work for him.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
A drink...
Why?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Hi, Daddy.
Okay.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
You got a deal. 
What? Forget it.
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
"Mike?"
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
How are you, Jim?
Call me back in ten.
Okay.  Lowell?
That's my stuff from the office...
Thomas Sandefur...
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
No, you do not.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Hardly new news.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Oh, please, Mike...
Everything interests me.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Good. I want to talk to you.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
Why am I gonna mention your name?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Tempura...
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
You believe that?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I'll call them, Lowell.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You mean... since this morning?
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
She's okay.
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
He --
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
After you, Doll.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
Grounds?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
I should be in therapy.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Thanks, buddy.
Asian? No.
It's your move, Miles.
What?
Yes?
What do you mean, was.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
No.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
It's about time.
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
What does your lawyer think?
You just haven't met the right person.
So I hear. Is that all?
Me. Yes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
She held that against you?
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
No, we're not!
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Fabric and fringe.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Those are gifts.
Marylin!
That's true.
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
It's not something I wanted either.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
My whole metabolism is -- off.
She did a Harriman.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I wish I had your discipline.
Well what does he want?
He has a reputation for being tough.
I'm dying.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
I guess.
Excuse me?
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
We've outlined a settlement...
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
She always looked out for me.
Nothing.
Sorry.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Who's "Patty."
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
Yes, sir?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
You're a peculiar chap.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Nothing. 
No.
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Why? Do you know him? 
I suppose so.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Any others?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Thanks.
. . . turn."
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
You win!
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Smart aleck!
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Um. You're doing all right.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
You always want to run everything.
I refuse to resign!
I'm following you.
Of course it is.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Yes.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What?
was so scared—that it scared—
Try me.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What for?
Why not? I'm hungry.
A black eye. 
Darling!
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Yeah, swell.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Same to you.
Come here, you little fool!
Do you know?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Isn't he here?
Get out!
Yes?
What time is it?
Thanks.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Well, I got it, Joe.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I am, Joe.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I ain't got a hat.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah. Come on—come on!
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Yeah—wouldn't it?
What?
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Why—no—
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Yeah, I guess you do.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Where you going, boss?
Yeah.
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
No, I did not.
Calm down, Dave, what?
What did they...
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
What was so appealing about Houston?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
How many shots you say you heard?
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Tough day.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
What?
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Huh?
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Take a look across the street.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
...and your General?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of you want to quit, do me a favor... put us out of our misery.
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Yes?
That sounds fun.
Six.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Not a problem.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I'll call her.
I won't forget.
Who was there for your ass?
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
I can't believe you do me this way.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
Course you didn't.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
I'm not saying another word.
What's in it?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Fine.
Can I see your I.D.?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I am, as a matter of fact.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Ordell pick up his bond?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
It looks nice.
The Delfonics.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
Surprise.
What'd ya see?
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
Right around here, in the food court.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
In the bag underneath.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Do you live together?
Not every day?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Can I smoke?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
You two meet?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Who's the other one?
What did you say?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
But you didn't do that.
Gimme one anyway.
Hi, Melanie.
Yeah, do you like it?
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I knew it.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Baby, I didn't --
All your money's in Mexico.
I do okay.
I'll give ya ten.
What'd you care?
She don't know shit about the money.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I can sit through it once.
Susanville.
It's a diet thing?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
You been to Japan?
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Uh-huh?
Okay, Lou-is.
Are you serious?
What do I do?
Okay.
You're outside?
That was Beaumont.
An employee I had to let go.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
It's in there.
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
He's a big one. You two tight?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Haven't a clue.
Yes.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
What does she do for you?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
And you did that to protect my interest?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
I know where it is.
No.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
Give me his home number.
Where do you want to go?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Hello, Sam.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Oh God!
I could have told you that.
It's short, huh?
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
It was the window.
Now what?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
An explosion, just like Paul's.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
How do you know?
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
Where to?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
No. The little one.
The best.
I don't like things that make you cry.
It's gone to the top.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
What?
I love you, Jez.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
What's he talking about?
Let go!
Stay away from me, Jez.
You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Stick with me, kid.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You've lived with me for two years.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Don't be funny.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Long time ago.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
The Ladder?
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Help me!
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
What's goin' on Paul?
You in trouble?
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
How did it happen?
Bring it in.
Pour it in.
Punk?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
And you said high school was boring.
Where'd you get the gun?
What are you gonna do, tell me?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
What are you doing back?!!
Two more charges to go.
I don't know!
My job.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
I hope so.
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if we don't?
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Were you close to your father?
You?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
I'm stuck!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
NO!
Later.
Oh my God! Adrienne?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
I'm just saying.
I'm afraid I cannot assist.
Are there any other shuttles?
Who are you apologizing to?
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Defense droids. I'm on it.
But?!!
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
You're crazy!
Hockey player? He's not a ...
What have I done?! Idiots.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Sure but what good will that do?
Sure, Dad.
What?
What do you mean 'We...?'
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Who's driving the boat?
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
I didn't agree to that!
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
My kids were on that beach...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
No, we just checked the beach...
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
I wish it would rain...
Is anyone having this...?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
You're leaving?
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
What do you see?
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'm supposed to be running.
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Were we together?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
No...
Yeah. That was me.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
I don't really know anything about it.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
You weren't even alive!
No, more commercial stuff.
You know... it's parts...
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
I actually know this one.
No?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
God, you're so young.
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
I heard that was you.
Really? Fingernails?
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Room with a toilet, got it.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Tore up from the floor up?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I am a suicide risk.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Keith's hot.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
A Pilates machine?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Don't mock me.
It's a loft.
So you don't do any of those things.
Almost.
Early, sing me a song.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Turkey mostly.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Who?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
...Then some.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
...Ha.
The party?
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
A book on the warehouse murders?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
What are you going to do?
Not yet.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Where would we find him?
17.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
To what? Virgins?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Yeah.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
He looks like my uncle.
What are you talking about?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
Nothen' B.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Right now?
You have?
Yeah. I can understand that.
Tonight?
How do you know?
But I'm scared Telly.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Bang up stuff.
Because, you know why. You know.
Why is that?
No.
You're OK?
Yeah?
Thanks.
Yeah?
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Oh god. That's horrible.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Four-thirty in the morning?
It's me. Telly.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
Yep.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
What kind of problem?
What are you saying?
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You are!  I don't like you.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
What?
What do you want?
Homesearchers.
I was at the beach.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
Run it down.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Who is this?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Where is she?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
You like to brag, don't you?
Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Very good.  How did you know?
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Why did he what?
That has nothing to do with it.
For what?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It's important.
And this Jeremy--
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
What does that mean?
The most logical choice.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
A building?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Just thought you might want to talk.
When I was very young.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Another kind of game?
How can you look at it so clinically?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Of course.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Because I think he's wrong.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
Then show me who you are.
The line was busy.  I'll try again.
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
Frank told me.
That's worse.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Colwyn.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You have rope?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
He has come for Lyssa.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
Let us wish him peace.
Use your sword.
No! You cannot know that!
Yes. It is today.
Yes.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
I have need of friends.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
You will follow me.
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Would you settle for a boar?
No.
I have a cinnamon bar.
I don't think it's working.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
Hush!
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
Then look!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
That I am, my lady.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Her name is Death.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
Ynyr!
It is no trickery.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
...What?
Yeah.
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
Well, I don't need them...
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Perfect.
You were scared, weren't you?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Yes.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Mathilda, stop, please!
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
What?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
I love you so much, Leon.
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  You met anyway?
...Yes.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
I have no fear.
Yes... Twice.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
Why am I such an authority?
I have new dreams now.
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
How serious is it?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
I won't let you die.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
I'll kill you!
Can it kill me?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
It's just a regular day.
What?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Where?
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Not our problem.
Not our problem.
This guy's not a murderer.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Nine.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
By car right?
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Yes.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She knew you loved her.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
What, come on?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
I need your help.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
Oh, that's not mine.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What are my choices?
No.
Water?
You what?
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Are you serious.
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
How much, do you think?
A date. What, are you a hooker?  What do you mean a date?  I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
Yuri... are you...
You're fired. I have new representation.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Yes.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Thank you!
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
Just the love in my heart.
What?
Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
Aristotle.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
What'd you do?
That's terrible!
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
No.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Licensed attorney or family member?
You're kidding!
You guys are so sweet!
Thank you. I love you, too.
So?
Power yoga?
Not yet.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
Thanks again for your help!
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
How do you figure?
No, she can't move for an hour.
We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
What?!
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
What happened?
Absolutely!
Where's Warner?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
Why not?
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Thank you. Having fun?
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Thank you.
Three months.
Where's the Rock?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Cunnilingus?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
And then?
I don't expect you'd understand.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
What!
What does she want from me?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Don't you care about what's happened?
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
It would appear so.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
It bodes evil.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
The chill is worse this night.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
The wound is mortal.
Can you save her?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Never show mercy!
Sapphire!
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
I may have said perhaps...
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Then, perchance you'll me.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
In the dark... where I join him...
You're teasing still.
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
No fear of that now.
Do I not please you, Jack?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
And sweet?
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
Heading north still?
Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
Oh, but I have.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
That very nice.
You follow.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Don't speak to me of dreams!  I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I wanna be with you today.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
What's wrong?
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Monday.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
What are you doing here?
Where to?
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
I don't know.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
What are you talking about?
Floating to Catalina.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
And if I enclosed it?
It's thirty feet.
He buys and sells the world.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I hate this job.
For everything.
She didn't really say.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I don't know.
Why would you be there?
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
You don't have a choice.
Goodnight.
Why?
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
Hi, Mom.
Nothing.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
What's wrong with your back?
Are you taking them still?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
Yes.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Thanks for telling me.
Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
Why would they tow your truck?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Let's go.
I think so.
You bit my finger.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't even...I'm there.
She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
The payoff.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Sooner than the Fall.
What?
Please don't leave me.
Sam took them to a movie.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Either do you.
Hey.
This is what he wants.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Can we really help build a house?
Someone stop her!
Dad's home, already?
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Is Spanky here?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
Take care of me?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Goodnight, Claude.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Nothing.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Here I am.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
So you made a generous contribution.
It ain't here.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
What about you, Radio?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
The hell you talking about? What train?
What am I gonna eat?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Him?
Let me see that.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
That was five years ago.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I said you're soft.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
You didn't get ketchup?
Move it out.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
He's sick?
Absolutely not.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Don't do it!
Urr... uggg... errr...
She's so nice.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
You're already there...
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
What can I do about it?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
You got it.
I know, your wickedness.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
That way.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You keep a bat under your seat?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Andrew.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
Basically, yeah.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
All right -- what are you?
From? From? From?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Where do you send them?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Just wondered... what happens?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
Well... you can't have them all.
I'm in my party mood.
Did you?
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I'm very smart.
Please... No.
No.  Just no.
No.
Curious.
Six. I go red next year.
All right.
What do you need?
Of course --
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Some people say children need human mothering.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Of course.
To what?
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
I don't know... but it does.
Where are you going?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
Gracious... no.
No, no, no
Not yet.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
It doesn't matter who we are. Follow the tunnel to the end.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
I don't think so.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
No, I'm okay.
They're comin' with us.
Sure, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
What do you mean by that?
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Yeah, I remember.
We should stop seeing each other.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Okay...
Alice, I...
Alice?
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
No.
The wife killer?
No.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
What about yesterday?
He won't give his name.
A headache?
I... I didn't say anything...
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
My... My head.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
That's absurd.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Thanks, guys.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
What?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
We just killed a couple of people...
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Yeah.
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Okay, brother.
I see.
Why, of course. Yes.
Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well - I'm—
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
How do you do?
I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
We follow many.
You have no disputes over women?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
The only one.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Shall we have another?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Yes.
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
What is it, my son?
Mine?
Yes.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
Dead?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
All right. Sorry, George.
Why - I'm sorry - but I—
I don't need any proof.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Yes, the little Russian girl.
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
What was that?
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
It's Fenner.
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Cowan--
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Well this didn't.
I'd go with number three.
Yup.  Sure is.
Kay...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Sir, you can't just--
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
She didn't even know you. .
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Why?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
What if he's telling the truth?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
For how long?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
In case I need it.
Kay!?
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
Actually, you may have.
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
You're not taking me in!
Come on now.  People are smart.
I dunno. One?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Yeah, Kay?
They're not my pals--
May I have a look?
Come again?
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Did it leave?
Can you see?
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
That's comforting.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Lara --
Uh-huh...
Hang on, Lamar --
What?
I go running down there.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Run the subscription list...
Yeah?  So?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Just a nickname.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
So?
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good-bye, Dad...
No.
Not if I stay away from him.
Do you?  Really?
Hold that thought.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
If... you have one.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you were retiring?
Sean --
I'll be right there.
My God...
Where are you?
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Who?
I know who you are.
Yes.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
We have snifters
Yeah. Take it.
Manhattan.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
He's okay.
He's alright.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm ready.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
What'd you say?
Draw.
Yeah, sure.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
No.
Yeah?
She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Tom, the Welsh dude --
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Well, this is the corner.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Thanks.
What are you saying?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
I'll page you.
I know the number.
I will.
Bye.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
Bullshit...
Fuck him.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Pretty nice.
Nah, don't bother --
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Don't even start.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fine.
She was jonesing for me.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
We don't need guns.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
Let's just go now and wait.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
'Strapped?'
Why? What I say bad?
You really in trouble?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
How's it going?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Word.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Tell me.
So tell me how it is.
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Goodbye.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Nnnnnnn!
I'll take your goddam bet.
Now.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
That's what Mama used to say.
Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
I sure met some.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Next week, Brother Minister.
You have enough worries of your own.
How old are you, Betty?
Yes. Did you eat?
I'm not made of glass.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
What do you want me to do?
Dear heart, I love you.
Betty it's me. It's me.
I'm tired of praying.
Let some of us come down there.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
What did I tell you about assuming?
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Just what is your question?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Entirely.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
Now you come back.
Me?
Fine as May wine.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
You the man!
Are you sure?
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
He's bright.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[I have a friend there.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Si.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Do you know who I am?]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[How do I recognize him.]
[I want you.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
I came to visit you.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Different door. Not far from here.
If they like me.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
The United States.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I'm a bargain.
No.
No.
I go to school, don't I?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Where?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
No, that was in Columbia.
Yes.
No.
I dropped her at home.
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
You got that right.
Planned what?
Our daughter.
What? Who?
That's ridiculous.
[Is that good or bad?]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
That's what friends do.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
What?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
What for?
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
Were the lights on?
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I don't.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
We just live one flight up.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
No, I'm not kidding.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Tomatoes.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Sure.
I heard you, Ma.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Hiya, Ralph...
What nurses?
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Hello, Thomas.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
No.  Or why you should.
Pour one for Painless.
He said it for us all, Walt.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Same general idea.
You make a mean martini, kid.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
Call Dago Red.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
But what about Major Houlihan?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
An eternal damnation.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
He can move in here with us.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
I think we could still have a chance.
Something else we have in common.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
You think he won't.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
I didn't have much choice.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
The one and only.
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Just in dreams?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Nice.
It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Um-hum.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
You got me.
Who?
Me?
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
There is no letter. I made it up.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Oh.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
That's—
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
What?
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
. . . Tubby?
I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
It must be some kind of a gag.
A gag. A gag!
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
The elevators are still runnin'.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Well?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
Shh!
You're my hero.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
They want Walter dead!
I need to get something straight first.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
Solis said to keep you clear of this.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
If you say so.
Like it had to be done.
National Marksman Competition.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Not the ones I'm at.
Every couple of months, huh?
I think I can handle that one.
Yes.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Why?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Okay, stop.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
To run late!
The jockey!
Pull up alongside.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
So what do you want to do?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
You worship yourself.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
You heard.
Can I come in?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
...Let me just show you.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
I'll provide you with transportation.
Who's running it?
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
I need to take back what's mine.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
No...
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Wake up?!
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
-- Yes.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
What?
Good question.
-- You told me.
It was a test.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
Access established.
Speed?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Now tell me... what do you see?
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
... Let's take a look over there.
WHITE TIGER!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
... I just pray we're not too late.
Where did it originate?
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
How about Major Moron?
Wait for me!
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
GO IVAN!!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
LET'S DO IT!?
NINJA FALCON ZORD!
But I've never served a day.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
I needed to see you again.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
No. We ain't even...
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Who?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Come off it, Bugs.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He's trying to make it.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
They're friends of our enemy.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
I found that out.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Okay. I'm listening.
Shuddup.
Spare us.
Come on. Be polite.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
Sad commentary, huh?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Bend over?
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Ohhh, nothing.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
He called me "Doc."
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
My <u>tail</u> itches.
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Behind the books.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
Mm hmm.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
... Oh ...
Where's the Majority Leader?
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Never.
It couldn't be.
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
You got worms.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Yeah. Funny--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
I apologize.
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
Susan? Nah!
Huh?
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Nonsense.
For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
Henry Hill.
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Y-yes, Jim.
Oh, a *boy*!
Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Why, of course.
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Uh--could--could I help--?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
For one week!
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Here--where are you running off to?
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Well--I'll go to Halifax!
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
Most natural thing in the world!
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Tonight.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
How?
Committee, huh?
Some committee's got it.
Calendar?
*This* is.
Thanks very much.
Try sitting down.
He did?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Why?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Saunders--!
Are you drunk?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
How are the pigeons?
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Goodnight, Senator--
I'm splendid, too.
Well! You don't say!
Well--I--
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
What's the matter?
Let's get away from here. 
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
No?
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Do you?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Oh yes, pixilated.
Uh-huh.
Always.
No.
Yes!
NO!!
What's that got to do with it?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What did they say?
Yes.
That depends on what they see.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'll get my hat.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Had the boys follow us.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Let me go!
What was that you said he was?
Mr. Cedar!
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Buffer?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
What're you talking about?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Shut up!
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
A child? My uncle's?
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Oh, the poet? Where?
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
South Dakota north.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Who?
You try it.
Yeah.
Me more than most.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Uh-huh.
No, not really.
Ernest, what do you think?
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Are we?
How do you mean?
Henry!
You are so mean.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
She seems very unhappy.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Oh, I don't know...
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Okay.
-- Go on!
Mother... go away!
There's something I think we need to talk about.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
No.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
You like it?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
Yeah?
That's... good?
I don't know if --
Is something wrong, Sofie?
I'm glad.
Okay...
You're not the only one...
It's called pro bono.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
That's not quite what I said --
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Do you think that's what he wants?
What'd he say?
No again?
Really?
He agreed?
How are you?
I understand.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
I wondered what happened to her...
Okay... let's say that, for now.
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I can tell you anything else.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
English Lit.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
You're completely reliable.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Even?
Sounds familiar.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Oh yes, always.
Intestines.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
To be hanged.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Want to know?
Really want to know?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
The things that get you excited.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
Who was talking about what?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
No you're not.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
FINE.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Way to go, Evy.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
What?
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Your mind is so slippery.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
And some sandwiches --
Atta, boy!
He was cute though.
The Inscrutable Six?
Should I kill them?
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Captain who?
Frankenstein!
Sure -- I guess.
Alone tonight?
Roy.
I just want to be a superhero.
What?
Monica!
Yes.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
Yeah.
Not a chance!
With what?
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
Shhh.
Oh shut up.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
We're superheroes.
Oh hi, Mom.
Mother... it's not what you think!
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
It's suicide.
I can appreciate what Your Majesty is saying but the Emperor has staked everything on this policy.  He has no other way to attack England, and no one knows more than Your Majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Proceed.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
No, thank you.
Are you serious?
Where are they?
You could have them here by daybreak.
Properly arranged, yes.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
It is on this road, sire, following me.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
I see...
Four o'clock.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Oh?
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
I very much doubt that he will.
I'll have the fire built up.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
No.
One had better legs.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I cannot promise you that.
I will never forgive you.
Promises mean nothing.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Yes, I wrote it.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Oh, then you are...
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
We have a treaty with Austria.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Anything you need.
Thanks, Unc.
Good.
Why you say that?
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
What happen?
Not me.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Thanks for reminding me.
That's the sister.
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
I don't.
That ain't gonna work.
Out the door and to the left.
I didn't see nothing.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
No.
What about me?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Hold on.
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
I do.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Have you seen Day-Day?
I saw it.
Excuse me?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Negative...they vamped.
You could sell your Beamer.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Let it go!
Go for it.
And some rolling papers.
Ya'll live around here?
He's a boy, dude.
I got fired too.
I don't know, Debo.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Shut yo' ass up.
Oooh, ba-by!
I threw my back, again.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
Huh?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Ah.
No.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
You wouldn't...
Good.
What's your point?
No, please...
I want'to talk to her.
Don't you threaten me.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I think you're right.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
What are you going to do?
What!?
I don't know.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Why?
Do it!
He carried on some; kicked.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Yes, Dad.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Don't!
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
So you ain't with the State no more?
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
Sshhh! He's in there.
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
All to pieces!
Come on!
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Amen.
What!
You better not sing that song.
'Cause you're too little.
She's gone to Moundsville.
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Why?
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
Ssh...
He ain't my Dad.
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Yes. Yes.
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Under the stone in the floor.
Come to me, boy!
Mm-hm.
That's no secret. I'm five.
What's your name?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
No.
Pearl and John.
She turned me out of the bed.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Yes.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
How'do.
Where's she at?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
None of your business, Madam.
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
Slept like a rock.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
No.
Yeah.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
You do?
My dream.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Krueger.
School.
I will.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Okay.
S'curity.
I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Have you any money?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
What was it like?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
What do you wear in the morning?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Or it might be the firing squad!
That's right.
I can tell you exactly.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
No, that's bad management.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Oh, yes, yes.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Yes, General Savitzky?
Certainly.
That's perfect!
While you eat, you look at the view.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Get out of here!
I'll send you a muff.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
A day.
Brave... that's right.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
That's even better.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Oh no. No visa.
Me?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
You're welcome.
How long does it take a man to land?
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
What are you after?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Then you should go back to your table.
No.
Yes.
Anything, Ninotchka.
I promise... I swear.
My darling.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No. Nobody will find us.
Much happier.
No, no music.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
No.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
In that case I can only say good-by.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
This will do. 
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this time.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
I figured that out.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Jesus!  Through a window?
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
That's what they're doing.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
That's right ...
I know it well, sir.
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
What's Liddy got?
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
All right.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Sir?
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
You never told him?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
I always get my man.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
The White House.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Agreed.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
What do you mean, Jack?
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
I like jazz ...
Elvis I like, too.
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
That's right.
Sir?
Yes, yes.
Well, we could delete it.
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
Not that.  Us.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
You.  What' you're doing --
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
The "crises"?
How's that?
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
Try "old" on for size.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Oh yes.
That's possible.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
No sir.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Okay.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I don't know. Had dreams.
To your husband.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
No. I found it.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Just keep it up.
Yeah.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Uh-huh.
I shall return.
Hey.
What makes you say that?
She'll be all right.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
Step out of the car please, sir.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Screwgie.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
You from around here?
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah? Where am I?
You know she won't be there.
So what're you goin' up there for.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
Somethin' like that.
The kind with the most poles.
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
No sir, it's unusual.
How well do you know Chigurh.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Okay. We can stop that.
You want to change rooms?
I got beers in my room.
I know how he found me.
I been immobile.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
What product.
No I don't have it.
I don't know.
I got an overcoat on.
Yes sir.
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Anyway, so what?
Oh. How come?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I'm sorry.
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Oh, Betty --
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
No, Del.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Yes, she is.
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
I ran back in to get the phone.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I got you, Del...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
What's his real name?
He has no heartbeat!
The one you were telling me about?
He has a wife?!
God, that's awful!
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
He is real.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Fine. You got five...
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
No...
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
What 'look'?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Should I kill him now?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
Like... us?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Half.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I know that.
Worse... you're in Texas.
Where? Where is she?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Very graceful. Perfect form.
What do you mean?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
...who doesn't?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
You better believe it.
I don't know, George...
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
What the hell's going on?
I SAID FORGET IT!
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Uh-huh.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
David Ravell.
I swear to God!
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Fire! I hate fire!
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Oh my God!
He was never turned into a frog!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Okay, Pappy.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Helluva awgazation.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
That's right, honey.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Don't I know it.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Aw, that's all right.
But... but...
Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Thank you, sir!
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Come over here where I can see you.
A long time ago.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
It's important, sir!
Aw screw it...
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
I called you Sarge.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
I said, come here!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
What?
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
I got my foot on the floor.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
My kinda group!
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I know who you are and what you want.
It sure was.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Twenty-two years ago.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
So?
I bet you do!
That's brilliant.
Yeah. All week long.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But she expects you to marry her?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Peace out.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
The fuck did you do that for?!
What do you think?  Get us into that room.
That's their problem.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
Keep your voice down.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Why?
The furniture guy?
Don't.
It doesn't work?!
Feel okay?
What am I, a five year old?
I don't know, why?
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
What are doing with yours?.
They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
I don't know. Look around man.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Can you make a deal with them?
They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
You mean...
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We need money first...
Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
Wait a second there brother...
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Right on Brother Judge...
What, I don't know how you mean?
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Maybe...
Nothing.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Where is he?.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Pride will do.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Very well, then.
Yes, sir.
Colonel will do.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
I consider them linked.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
Granted.  Where are you going?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
He left us.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Thank you.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
How many men have we seen die?
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Quiet.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
I will. Come and kiss me.
For a little while.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I'm sure you're not.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Yes.
I don't know.
Does she love the cat?
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Why? For God's sake, why?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
What?
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
It's beautiful!
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
I got eggs down here!
Yes, I guess I do.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Wait as long as you like.
All right then.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
That so?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Did you, now?
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Thank you, sir.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Yes -- yes.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
To the Black Pearl.
Yes, the rum is gone.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
We're not going to just surrender!
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Smith.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Pirate.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Good.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Aye!  Avast!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
Jack!
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Where did he come from?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
A moment.
Speak.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Who isn't?
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Is that so?
You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Daniel!
What?  What's wrong?
What about it!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Probably the caffeine.
The nanobot... it's not here...
What did you want my hair for?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Where is it?
Did you think I could just leave you...?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
I guess they do.
Yeah, and what might that be?
Oh yeah?
The question is, are you?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
So, it's obvious, huh?
For what?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Of course I am Stewart.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
I poisoned him.
Good morning. What does this mean?
You can't walk out of here like this.
You're acting like a child.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Mother!
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
You're the Tribune man?
Is that so?
Huh?
Is that so?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah?
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
A what?
My play.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you—
I bet.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
—and that—
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Nothing.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
I have it here.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, come right in.
That's putting it crudely, but—
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Yeah?
Sure.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
It doesn't matter.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Looks just like it did.
What?
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
... It's a pretty short trip.
Yes she is.
Yeah. It does.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Where are you gonna go?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
You want to get out of here?
So.
It's better, Mary Sue.
That's not going to happen!
No it couldn't!
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Yes I did.
It was accessible to everyone.
Why am I out of order?
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
I don't know.
As a matter of fact he does.
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
It's in your closet.
Well if I don't who will?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
What?
Right here.
Oh ... Right.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Rain.
I'm not sure.
Ooomph?
Because we don't belong!
I can't.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Why?
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
... Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Forget about that!
Yeah.
Hi.
I brought you something ... From the library.
I'll never be able to do that.
No, that's not it.
Just a little--You know.
What happened?
Cool.
So you can't talk to me?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
So you're coming tonight, right?
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Did I say that?
I don't know.
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't know.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
I just want to know where she's staying.
Hi, is this Jack?
I'm just laying on my bed.
Are you watching a porno movie?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
You're going to work now?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
You don't even know how much it is.
We got disconnected before....
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
I don't know.
Ok.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Sure.
Ok.
....Hi.....
About six months.
Yeah?
Yes.
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
This is nice.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
It's ok to ask that.
I'm fine are you ok?
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
For what?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Sorry.
Hello, how are you?
Yes it is.
......and this is confidential?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
I think you have a call?
....I have seven.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Hi, Lance.
You're goin' on a trip?
Wait a minute --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Alright, alright.
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't be late though.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
When can you leave?
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Nothing.
No.
Ok.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
"Turn you out?"
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
Enough to discern its tenor.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
Valcour. His chair.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Coulmier, you animal!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
He's sworn to obedience.
Oh indeed?
What could cause a tincture like this?
You'd suffer in her stead?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Poorly.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Yes?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it awfully violent?
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Tell him I'm no fool. A prison's still a prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.
No. But tell him I would.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
Very much.
Am I?
Houdini mice.
To make pictures.
Over at RKO?
Yeah
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
How much?
Yes.
I wanted it
Sir? 
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
He personally asked you to?
Showing life
Who the hell's Manolete?
I don't wanna write about no spic.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
So speaks the court jester.
How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?!
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.
She was . . . innocent
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
But it's not a great syllable
What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?!
Kinda.
Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Again
Again
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
The ad..
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
We done?
I'm Christ
For what?
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
What do you mean?
What did Tommy say?
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
You sound bitter.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Should I hit it?
No.
It's OK.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
No, I'm not.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
What did I say?
I never noticed his face.
Positive.
"Father of the Bride."
Yeah --
Why don't you just call him?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Never felt better.
He should.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Oh. When are they expected home?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Do that.
I was jaywalking.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Mrs. Thorwald.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Like an old hambone?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Congratulations, Jeff.
You did.
With that cast on -- you don't.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I don't know what you mean.
Well, I only quote from the best.
She expects me to marry her.
No.
Stella!
She's just not the girl for me.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Get back there! He'll see you!
You called the police?
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
What?
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart girl.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Mrs. Doyle?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Empty as a football.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Without any future?
Nothing, thank heaven.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
Something too frightful to utter.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Women aren't that unpredictable.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Too close.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Stay there.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
I was in it.
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Will you wait a minute?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
Sorry.
Have some cigars.
I think I know my son.
He's just loaded, honey.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
Open it.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Yes, sir.
In my mother's drawer.
What?
I just don't want trouble.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Who knows.  Plato?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
We know.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Who?
I'm here.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Good Lord!
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
I don't know why--!
And your folks didn't understand?
Where what was.
Who lives?
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
I'm numb.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I'm never going back.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
See, we're very modern.
Are you?
You don't need to do that.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
What?
My mother?
Hi.
I didn't want to stop.
What are you doing here?!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
...whoever she is.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
No, no --
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Yes it was all you --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
I'll see what I can do.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
What?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
I'm almost done.
If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Who wouldn't.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
Bam Bam.
Hey.
Christmas... Eve...
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
Put it on.
At least gimme video poker.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
How'd you know my name...
Show's over.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Acid-chewer.
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Five years. Since it opened.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
Not with you.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Haven't thought about it.
Yeah.
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
What, working security?
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
No, man! No, no, no!
And you set me up.
What? No...
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Fine, now.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Where was she from, Compton?
What?
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Sorry, it's my book now.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
Don't ask me that.
You do?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
I don't believe in it.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
He ain't dead.
I think he's just passed out.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
He asked.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Maybe he did.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
His letters will keep.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
You're not going out to look for them?
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Maybe they will.
To the other side of the street.
So did I. They were in it.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
All right. I'll tell you.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Finished, son?
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
You want to split up? --
Kind of sore.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
All right, you didn't know.
Nobody asked you to.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
I like it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Yes, people make me restless.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Depends on how good you drive.
They shouldn't have done that.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Stop it --
I don't know -- I don't know.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
I sure would.
No. We're not stayin' --
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
And you've got me all figured out?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Okay.
Hello Ray.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Alright!
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I think so.
It's okay.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Not in a thousand years.
Made you say it!
Yes!!!!
Quick, everyone to the lab.
We have to destroy him.
My child, you're alive!
We? What do you mean... we?
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Who?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
You do.
Just a little Rogaine.
That's right.
Thanks, handyman.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
You don't think...
Is MOM... in there?
No more violence... No more violence...
It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
I certainly did not.
Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!
Is there a killer loose?
Looks good, Mom!
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
That's nice.
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
Don't I get a kiss?
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Yes, I did.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
I do, please.
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Yes... but... I didn't...
Right here!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Bon Appetit!
Yes you are.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Sure I do.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Which room is it?
Yes.
No.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
What sort of danger?
Hello, Frances.
But I like teaching school.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
She showed me a drawing.
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Good night.
Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
We could tell him.
I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
And then?
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I keep telling myself that.
I understand.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
What a peculiar question.
She was my patient.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
I've lost my knack.
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Unless what?
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -—will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
Please.
What did he say?
Yes?
Television?
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
What's the first?
I feel like they do.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
You're in therapy?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Who's Donna?
Yes.
Everything about sex.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Don't you want to make one?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Sometimes. Afterward.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
You said you weren't always impotent.
What was the problem?
Don't you get lonely?
God, I m so mad at him!!
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I don't care.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
Mmmmm...
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Isn't therapy helping at all?
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
What do you mean?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Is he still at your house?
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Not really.
Yes.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, what, then?
What kinds of questions?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
You don't know that for sure.
Did he touch you?
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
I don't want to discuss it.
It looks like a tablecloth.
There's a phone here.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
She still is.
Not exactly.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
No.
Just a moment.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
When I was fourteen.
He said that my hand felt good.
Okay.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Could be risky.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
You told Ann about this?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Did he put you up to this?
I like having the car, the car is important.
So is my wife, asshole!!
No.
Yeah.
He'll be really mad.
Hi. Want a drink?
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Uh, OK. Sure.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Down to the incinerator.
Gonna cut me open?
BREAKING OUT
What's cookin', Bert?
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Dentonvale has been sold.
Who trusts experts?
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
...closed?
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Who?
It's...
You're practically naked!
YOUNG BLOOD
No...couldn't I do this later?
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
Do you really think so?
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
What does he know about it?
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
We're not confused.
Good. That's good.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Gary.
Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
I'm working on it.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Let me call Christine.
When do we get to drink it?
Just a minute!
Whoa.
So you're going to stop acting?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
How do you know?
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
I want to go home now.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
Well, she is cute.
Nah. I want to watch this.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
We were supposed to play golf.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Nope.
Obsessively.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
What's happening?
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Thanks.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Yeah.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hold on.
I'm fine. You rest.
The Windmill.
Twelve months in oak.
That's what I'm having.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Thanks.
Sure.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
What rehearsal dinner?
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
So what's happening with your book?
I guess.
Exactement!
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
This one?
No dad!
It tastes funny.
I heard them Morgan.
Me too.
You love walks.
I heard.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Yes.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Yes.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
From what?
Me too.
I'm close.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Me too.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
No.
What did you say?
Don't worry.
You're in here for winging a guy?
McKendrick.
I'm sorry.
They've been kind to me.
This is a brutal land.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
And they were two of them. Look --
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Where's the pinto going?
Where's Turley?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
Going to Turley, was it?
I expect.
I saw the light. I thought maybe Rae had come back to see me. But I never thought it'd be my boy. I never thought that.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Why?
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
He'll be here.
Howdy.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
Don't press your luck, Carter.
We'd rather stay.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
It's none of your business.
Rae, I need help.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Why would they stop you?
Lucky.
Where's Emmett now?
I heard that too.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
What's she got to do with it?
You like a good saloon?
Who's the owner?
He left me.
That was my plan.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
Please.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Simone does not control my destiny.
Soon.  Soon.
-- I can explain.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Thank you.
Do what?
I do?
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I want you back too, Viktor.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
It was a great show, Dad...
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Well, I --
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Yes, call me Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
It was more in passing.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Simone!
I've seen them all before.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
You saw that?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I read.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Lainey...
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
It's a yacht.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Er,... good.
Why?
You're in breach.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Yes.
Good.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
... digitized.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Dr. Crowe.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
That's good.
If it's okay with you?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
I forgot myself.
Dr. Crowe.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
What?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
I don't know, Cole.
When?
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
No, we're not.
No.
You do?
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Maybe.
Lots of things.
Tell you my secrets.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
Chuck E. who?
What are you talking about?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
...Hi.
The band.
I didn't do anything --
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
-- "Billy-Jean" --
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Metaphysical question, man.
"-- an AXE!"
Pardon?
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Nothing to tell.
Nah. Just you.
Let it go.
I said that's enough!
Look. You want to talk about this?
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
It's you. You and your father.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
No. Not without you --
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Why bother?
Bill, we need to talk!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Whatcha' doin'?
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Yeah. Good.
We're coming your way, man!
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby!
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
I got to leave my post.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Okay.
Grant, no!
Grant, you're sick!
What other stuff?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Margaret.
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Driving?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
We lost him.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Enjoy your Kenworth.
He's after us again!
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You could've asked.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
How do you know?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Weight Station.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
That man is your father?!?
Absolutely.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
Yes.
You sure do.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
Go.
Yeah?
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Can a pig whistle?
What does the old Timex say?
I'm at marker eight-five.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
We're gone.
I'm here.
I'm cucumber cool.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Yeah, but...
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Pick it up, Breaker.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Yes, ma'am.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
That's the point, Dickey.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
That's correct.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
Yeah.
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Mmm-hmm.
Damn... alright then.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
Jack, if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Then what --
I said I got his machine.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- okay, g'head --
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
I'mma grip and rip girl.  I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
Leave the light off.
I can trust Rheya.
All right.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
Yes.
Why, who did you see?
How much sleep?
What was it?
What is it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Not necessarily.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
You didn't look very happy.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
I did too.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Gibarian.  He was here.
You should have told me.
Neither did I.
I never said I didn't.
I can't stay here.
Yes, you are --
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Hard to find doors in this place.
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
No, Ma'am.
Beg pardon?
Not too sure about that.
I'll come with you.
Sooner, the better.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
So it was "love".
And "is"...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
You don't like him, do you?
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Oh that thing in Queens.
Do you dance?
Long enough.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Sure we are, let's go!
I don't know Tommy.
I'm all right.
What?
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I'll be right up.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
What's the difference?
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
I heard.
It should've been me...
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
I know.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
They'll never take me alive.
Don't be pitiful.
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Mr. Jameson--
A spider.  Eight legs.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Thanks, I already ate.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Huh?
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Does it have a human name?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
I know what you mean.  I...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
So you've found Thorkel?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Oh, Peter. A zit.
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Really, Professor, I--
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Like it?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Just drop me off here.
I'm not so happy myself.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Any news on Dunbar?
Coming up.
We'll get some more.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
You stink, Sefton!
And maybe a little something else?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Twenty-five.
Not you.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
What exactly is he charged with?
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Some are not bad at all.
They'll shoot you, Animal!
Me? What if she don't want me?
No?
What do they always say?
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Yes, sir.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You did!
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
What about the radio?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Here. Take them.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Yes, you do!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Twelve years, sir.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Can you project its course?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Commander.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
The station complement was nineteen.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
I was ordered to by the Captain.
No.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
Understood. That will be all.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
The thought had crossed my mind.
Thank you.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
Scotty...?
... Fascinating.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
A photon tube...!
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Aye, sir!
Just him, sir!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
I'll need it, Sulu.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
No, sir, no response.
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Report status!

Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Understood, my lord.
Success, my lord.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Ah.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
The matrix formed in a day. The life forms grew later -- at a wildly accelerated rate. Can I cook or can't I?
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
You know what she'll say...
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Let them eat static.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
I'm going down to the station.
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded.
Give the word, Admiral.
He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
Not at present.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
The word is given: warp speed.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Yes.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Be careful, Jim...
Best speed, Scotty...
Uhura, patch me in --
Yes, sir.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
They just don't want us going in there.
Aye, sir.
Aye, sir --
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Engage warp engines --
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
I'll try, Captain.
Aft thrusters, sir.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
You do this -- for friendship?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Just a couple of kooks...
Fine. Just fine.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Please...
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
We've done it before.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
-- That's the general idea.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
... Best shot...?
It is.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Implicitly.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
You want the details?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Kirk. They're gone.
You need me.
... You have a point...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
In progress, Admiral.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Explain.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Yes?
I cannot tell a lie.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Right.  Will you help us?
They did, Admiral.
I will, Admiral.
Weapons systems?
Steady as she goes...
Aye, sir!
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
On my way...!
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
You will be in good hands here.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
... an offlander?
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
This way!
You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide.
You're what?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Androids... don't have...fun.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Captain, Geordi...?
From the mission...
Another time.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology.
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
The Ba'ku.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
You got me, Commander.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
... so they need us to put out one more brush fire.  Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Aye, sir.
Sir?
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Why was Data assigned?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Augh?
All ship functions are off-line.
Absolutely.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
No... no, please... you cannot...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Ready quantum torpedo.
What?
Where's the Sphere?
Contact Starfleet Command.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Understood. Keep me informed.
How serious is the damage?
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Always am.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Altitude fifty kilometers...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
You're lying.
Some.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
On screen.
Fire.
Data, set a course for that vortex.
Go to manual.
We're still in Earth orbit.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
We've lost Bridge control!
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
We've been set up all along.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Don't remind me.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Very much.
You feign ignorance?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
How can I trust --
Yes.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Well, I -
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
I know what you mean...
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
I like it here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Anything else you want to tell me?
Except us.
Possibly.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
You have personally -
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
They're dying.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I am uncertain.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
Spock, you want to know something?
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
You can't prove any of this...
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
Nevertheless.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
You are me.
I am in a room with lights.
No.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
I know.
No.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Good work. The download?
It would appear so.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
An individual more like you, you mean.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Counselor?
This isn't real.
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
What do we know about the planet?
What do we know about the population?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Aye, sir.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Just lucky, Admiral.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
Who was it?
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Thank you, sir...
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Counselor?
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Praetor Shinzon?
And the Senate supports you?
New worlds.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
He is what his life has made him!
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Please.
It is... invigorating.
Should I raise shields?
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
I don't want to scare them away.
Elmo's...
About five miles back.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
When can we expect containment?
It's taken on a disguise.
What?
Okay...
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Eh... police.
Gas good?
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
I am Jenny Haydn.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Shit... shit... what shit?
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
Shit!
It was yellow.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
But I speak English.
Yes.
I was afraid.
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Are you my friend?
I am your friend.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I do not want to.
Yes. Sing some more.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
Horses.
Do they talk?!
What for?
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I will say that we can be friends.
Where?
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Get Fox.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Wait'll you see it.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Yes.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
You saw that?
I wouldn't think so.
No problem.
Fuck you.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Forget it's there.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Damn right.
Tell me.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Shutup a second!
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
You bet.  Did you like it?
I won't say anything.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this shit caused by a random traffic stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that.  Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos.  You gotta take what you can, while you can.  Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
She never gave me a tape.
Strickland.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Fumitsu.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
No idea.
Wants to share.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Sure.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Why?
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
You really want that on your head?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
What?
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
You know, you ever think about other women?
Why me? What do you want from me!?
He had an orange hat on.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
At the field office.
Another what?
What are you doing?
This better be important.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Go ahead.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
What I do requires confidentiality.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I was looking for a pattern.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
Not especially.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
The other reason?
This is some serious shit.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
What's this country coming to?
Don't be too harsh.
Does Koessler ask about me?
We did find these, however.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
That's true.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Jaime? Where are you?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
And you're working with him?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
Yes, sir.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
What did you do to end up here?
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I know, I know.
You're right. I know.
No. Stop, come on.
What do you drive?
What kind of car do you drive?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Why? You're not a real man?
Yeah.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Anything.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
What an asshole.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
I'm a comedian.
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
Why not?
Yeah. And an actor.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
Are you on the other line?
...Six months.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
I thought you met someone else.
Why didn't you call?
Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Right.
Right.
It sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
No problem.
It's a gig.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Ah, there's the rub...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
It's unbelievable.
Go for it, man.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
She wasn't your type anyway.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
You always know the right thing to say.
Make someone bleed.
So, what? Eleven?
You asshole.
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
She's really special, guys.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
S'up Trent?
What are you talking about? Vegas?
When?
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
She smiled, baby.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
No! Not the camera guy!
What?
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
No, baby. You're money.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
What?!?
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Yeah.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
...through the kitchen...
...It looked money.
Minnie Pearl.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
No, baby!
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Oh. He's got it under control...
You could make their heads bleed, though.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
What was cold about it?
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
Be smart about it.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Good.  He never doubted you.
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
You have to answer for Santino.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
No, just you and Paulie.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
How bad will it be?
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
And with prison record.
When did he call?
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
For killing a man.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
You look good, too.
That's for you to find out.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
Can you do it Mike?
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Did he give you his politicians?
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Al Capone!
Michael...
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Huh?
Please say it.
OK. 
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Goodbye.
Don't you want dinner first?
Don't ask me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
How's Mom?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Until the old man tells me different.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
He talked to you?
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
No, I like him.
Yes please!
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Say again?
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
What?
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
What club?
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
So tell me.
Tom, I don't love you.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Bird. That's jazz.
I absolutely agree with Marge.
What about Cortina?
Ha. Did he say why?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Get on. I'll take you to him.
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
To the manner born.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
What?
I can explain.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
How did you know that?
Is Freddie in Rome?
I'll take them both.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
I can't later.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
I'm fine.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
You're such a liar...
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
November, I thought.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Huh?
Nah. I ain't interested.
Who mam?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
I know. I could have picked you up.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Oh. Who was that again?
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Keep it.
Hello, Betsy.
Thank you, Travis.
This is gotta be a game, right?
Ouch!
Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
No.
What did you do?
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
For a fee.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
Iris.
I can leave anytime I want.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
You just gonna leave 'em?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
My work may take me out of New York.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Damn straight.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
Yes.
I can't sleep nights.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
How's your driving record?
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Oh?
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
What's going on?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Hey Wizard.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
I'm a field agent.
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
The cell, Mason.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
Hi.
I am, too.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Okay.  What's the second thing?
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Well...
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
And why not?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
What?
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Yes.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
No, sir.
But what?
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
When did I leave?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Vultures...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
I guess I did.
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
That's not the country Luke fought for.
It's wrong, Leo.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
No thanks.
When was that?
No, I...
Thanks.
The customers?  I don't know...
Oh.
You bet, honey.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
I already have.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Yes.
Lovebirds.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Different?
A trifle.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Yes?
I know.
I don't know yet.
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
That's where the Brenners live.
Mmmm.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Okay.
The little Brenner girl?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Impossible.
Shall I call the doctor?
They're back!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
That's a chance we have to take.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
Oh, my God, look at her!
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I started to say... inside...
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
Would you like me to go for her?
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Well, I...
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
Aren't these lovebirds?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
Ahhh, but I know you.
We met in court.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
He was watching a ball game on television.
His wife changed the channel.
Yes, I was lying.
I wrote the letter.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Like what?
Helping travelers.
I'm glad you do.
No, tell me.
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Are you staying?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Take wing!
Mmm?
After the gulls attacked.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
The bay doesn't.
Inland.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
And he'll talk?
Yes.
Do you have any lovebirds?
How soon?
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
How?
With smoke.
Not if they're starting a war.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Of course.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
It is a pity.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Aye.
I'm sorry for the woman, Fettes. But her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens.  As for me, Fettes, I let no man stop me when I know I'm right -- when I know that I need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge.  And if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor, you'll see it as I see it.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid of what?
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've had some experience.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
I've drunk enough tonight.
Only Brother.
No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
I come from Lisbon.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Aye --
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
I'm looking for my friends.
You're wrong.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Tell her... we'll get him.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Keep that thing away from me.
Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's what Lauren would do.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
I do. Every day.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
What did I say?
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
I don't believe you.
He'll be there at 8:30.
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
That was my first question.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I assure you such power exists.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
What do you mean, dear?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
Yes -- I think so.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
About 250 million of your miles.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Thank you... Have you any news?
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Remember those words.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
This one could save your life.
He's my brother.
Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
We don't ride with vampires.
Zero.
El Vampiro.
They're gonna book us.
Maximum body-count.
The meanest!
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Yeah.
No.  Stick around.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
I will, David!
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
I can't do that!
Hit the lights again.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I better get cleaned up, then.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
For what.
No.  I'm up.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
I'm tired now.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Michael!...
Smells like something died.
Soon.
Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
But, Mom...
No, I'm not...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I hope so.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Star.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Because I love you...
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Save Laddie first.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  On the phone.
Piss off.
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Huh?...
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Dogs don't eat each other.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Maybe.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Don't walk behind me.
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Hell no.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
The dogs?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
What do you mean "you think so?"
Thank you.
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
We going to make it?
I ain't going with Sanchez.
Just keep looking.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
What for?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Who else could have used that key?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
I had an accident.
Where?
What kind of stories?
This is it?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
Yes.
I'm used to that.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
The air... the power.
What do you mean?
End...?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I don't understand.
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
I know.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Why is it -- breaking up?
Got here as soon as I could.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Do you know you were humming?
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
How romantic...
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Thank you...
Sir...?
Yes...
Thank you.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Every night.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It must have been safe.
You lost someone.
Is it?
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
May I get you some --
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
No...
Why?
New Yorkers.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I suppose so.
Kalen...
They're inside --
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
What about Starks?
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
That's too bad.
I never touched your father! I swear!
No, it hasn't.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Well, you belong in one.
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not.
Then, where are you going?
You're not crazy.
Believe me, I know.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
[Beat] I don't know.
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
You have no idea what's going on.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
Well, what time is it?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Who told you this?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
I wasn't talking about anything.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Is it true?
No.
No, I'm ok.
Thanks.
Uh-huh.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Yes, baby?
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You girls are in some hot water.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
My Lord.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
What's wrong?
What for?
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Can't it go to any office?
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
Why now, Jimmy?
Oh yeah.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Yeah!
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Get the car!
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Give me the keys.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Try to.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Why not?!
Alright, Louise!
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
We should have just ignored him.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
Shoot the radio!
Yeah, you want it?
You know why.  You already said.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What do you mean?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
We can change our names.
It'd have to be pretty good.
What?
Yup.
About two hundred and fifty miles.
What?!
You, too, sweetie, the best.
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Fresno.
So you admit it?
I guess.
He implied it.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Yeah, right.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Well... at least now you know.
Huh? But why did Healy?
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Hm?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ you're right.
Out getting coffee.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Call you back.
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Yep.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Ahh.
No thanks.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
No, I mean
Here you go.  What's that smell?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
-- Love story of our time.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
What?
Huh... that's strange.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
You don't buy what?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
So you found Mary?
Huh?
Oh my.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
What?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who?
Bullshit!
Nice.
Four.
What?
That must make it tough.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Where would I have seen your work?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
You mean he's not a criminal?
Oh Jesus...
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, it's an old football injury.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
You betcha!
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Oh great, I ran out.
What are you?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
All right, let's go.
Toy poodle!
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
You got what stuck?
It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
What do you mean?
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Says what, Kenny?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
This is from the Highest Authority?
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Dean Rusk!
I, uh...
Not as far as the election goes.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
I don't know. I don't know.
I know, I know...
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
That may be what they want us to think.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
You're my hero, Carl.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Good. Thank you.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
Who the fuck is he?
Beats the hell outta me.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
How'd you know?
Go ahead.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
That's right.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
Let the press through.
After we've completed our investigation.
Watch out!
You've got no jurisdiction.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
His spiritual mother...
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
And...
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
What are you talking about?
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What do you mean?
So they took care of Leo.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
We're going for The Stronghold.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Good.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
It's not that.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Where were you?
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Too aggressive?
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Used to what?
Make what?
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
About as much as they think about killing me.
And now?
In that order?
Where'd you get it.
I'm fine.
What?
I sit. I think. I play games.
How does it go?
True.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
Well?
F-14's sir.
Yes sir!
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Remember one thing.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Okay.
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
You go. I'm staying with it.
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
I want him!
What'd you do?
Don't.
Was.
I didn't ruin her.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
Nope.
Just below ten thousand.
Tell me one thing.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Yes sir.
Then why are you here?
You think I should quit?!
I never heard that.
He ain't got five kids to feed.
Why not?
But maybe you can change all that.
Who are you?
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
I know that.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Nice to meet you.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
Hetero.
Brunette.
Sleazy...and demure.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Relax, you'll live longer.
You tell me.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
You went to Rekall, remember?
Up to the right.
I've got Quaid.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Mmmm.....
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Nobody.
All right, forget about it.
I'm late.
Some men just tried to kill me!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
What's he talking about?
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Oh, since when?
You two-faced-bastard.
The reactor.
The one in the mine!
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
No problem.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
In a minute.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
No.  We go straight.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
You got that right.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
You're hung up again.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Me, too.
Right.
We got a plan!
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
LET'S DO IT!
True.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Sustained.
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had a description of the suspect.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
I feel much better now.
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
-- Roger -- ?
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
EXACTLY!
Want to tell me what went down here?
...Okay...
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You tell me, man.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
"No," what?
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
Don Reynard.
This and that.
That's big of you, Bob.
Argumentative.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
And who was Arturo Esparza?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
-- Every word.
-- What trial?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Yeah, we do some of that.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
I want you.
Get lost Bobby.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Bobby...
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
What?
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
What do you mean?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's what I heard.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Well, why not?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
Donna, you are a muffin.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
No, you should forget about last night.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
I can't help you there.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Who would do that?
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Hiking?
Trees?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Sure you do, it's good for you.
Dad...
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Stay away from me.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
Who am I?
Nothing, I chickened out.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
What does it mean?
I wouldn't do it.
No.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You may step down.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, we...
...We did everything we could...
Hold on a second.
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
I. Yes. It is.
Hi. How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Thank you for seeing me.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
Overruled...
The TV didn't work.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case...  I have some, uh... I have some work to do...
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work.
Isn't there something you...
What is that to you...?
Yes. Price...
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Yeah.
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Oh shit, what's today?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
We got to talk.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't want a mistrial.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
We'd be in all the papers!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Can you handle one of these?
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
Right.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
So is the town, I notice!
It's always been a good persuader.
It was nearer than that.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
He's very excited about it.
You get any sleep last night?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Heather, has there been another call?
No.
Is he all right?
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
You have a fever, sweetie?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
What?
I like this story.
Your bed?
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Read me some?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
It can be captured, sometimes.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Not yet.
Yep.
He knows.
I haven't forgotten.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
I didn't know sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
No, I can't.
What do you mean?
That's what they get for not locking the door.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Figured what out?
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
It was a bad dream...
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Me too.
Yes.
I can't watch this.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Who?
It was my fault.  I slipped.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
They have every right Chuck.
I don't know.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
I should be eating with the crew.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
It has nothing to do with him.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
They'll know about it in the morning.
She's Cuban.
Shut up donut.
What is it... the secret?
It seems we're short on singers.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
What's that?
No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
You've gotta be kidding?
Son of a bitch!!
Sir.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
He climbed when he was ready.
What's that supposed to mean?!
Artie? That you, Artie?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
You an indian?
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
She really say she was pregnant?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Have now.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
Used to.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
I'm sorry.
Hasta siempre.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
You ain't actin', mama.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
What's that?
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
You do.
Where?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Yeah.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
You think she's gonna make it?
No radio or TV...
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
I'll come along.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
Damn!
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
That's not why I called.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Yes... Get rid of him.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Yes.
Yes.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
No.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
He's right, you look horrible.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
You're welcome.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
She left me. Crabs.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Back up. Go out the other way.
Tripp, where the hell...
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Maybe... I don't know.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
So sensitive.
Ye-es?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
Find the jacket.
Don't touch it.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
No wonder he screwed us over.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Excuse me?
It's mine.
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
You're in Kinship?
Yea?
...You carry firearms.
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
Heaven?
That's really it.
So I'm told.
Like the lady herself.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
You?
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
What'd he say?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Your aunt?
Jesus, James. Wow.
Where's that?
Kinship.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
How can you tell?
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
I didn't mean it that way.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
Grady!
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Who does?
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Simple.
Hm.
Yes.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Caps.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Grady.
Are you sure you parked it there?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
And you're old.
I told Walter.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I'm not sure that's possible.
This is important.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
I don't know. It might be...
Her husband.
As a heart attack.
The perpetrator.
I might have his number on campus.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Beautiful. How's business?
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
Isn't it?
I'm not a monster.
You don't have to tell me this.
Sure.
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
It's a bright sound.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Why don't you just tell me?
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Who said I wanted to buy it?
Yes.
No.
Woodsman?
What?
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yeah.
Lovers' quarrel?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
How come?
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
What will happen if I do?
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
That was a joke.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
A diary?
Ev-i-dence.
You think reflection is good.
No fucking way.
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
They usually tell me.
Is this the first one?
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Not so fast.
We're little kids.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
Are you okay?
Me?
Most women wouldn't choose it.
I'm just quiet.
Neither do you.
What do you think?
K through sixth.
What about them?
What?
I molested little girls.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
How many girls did you molest?
What?
Walter.
Why young girls, Walter?
I know.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
What?
I'm not scared.
Live together.
Who doesn't?
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
I'm not scared.
Do you want to talk about it?
Not when they fly.
Piece of cake, baby.
Where're you?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Hey, you okay?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
How?
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
God, I hate that bitch.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
You watch yourself.
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
What's the timer set for?
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
She'll wait.
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
What! After giving us such a run around...
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why do you tell us this only now?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, very much so.
But then when will we see each other?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Late, very late.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Tell me once more.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
You say that just to flatter me.
No.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
But for what reason should I come there?
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
There too...
Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
No, not like this one.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Who?
Why?
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
Why?
Dear Jesus...
That wasn't me.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Right now?
Oh, yes!
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
In the confessional.
Did it hurt?
And what happened?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Does it bother you?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
No... do you?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Yes.
I could never be a mother.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Everything... I don't have children.
I'm not sick.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
I breathed!
No...
I can't.
... makes me...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Her headaches.
No I'm not.
Yes.
Yes.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Someone's following me.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you think it's there for?
Yes.
Yes.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
Sister...
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Thanks...
Marty, what are you doing here?
If I find anything I'll call you.
What about Roger? He's free.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
How do you survive?
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Uh huh.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
What business is it of yours..?
Yes.
That's ridiculous...
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
About two years before.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
There's another choice.
Aquittal.
Oh, some time in January.
Earthquakes?
Nothing.
Was the child full term?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Yes.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Bullshit!
And what has that to do with it?
No, it reminds me.
I'd love one.
Long, thin and filtered.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Begin what?
Would it stop you if I did?
You're what?
You're saying God did it?
She is an innocent.
Yes.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
The scandal...
I left it with her and I went for help.
Then she's a liar.
What happened to the baby?
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
We'd be thrown out.
Shurrup!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
What they like?
I'm a deserter, too.
Yeah.
The police station.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Bag-snatcher.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
But I won't.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Ah well. Eh, look!
We do.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
What's that mean?
The big hammer?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Why selfish?
You can learn from books.
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What?
Nothing good.
Eh?
You see, sly villains.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
That's all right then.
For Ringo.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Hiding.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
You needn't bother.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Hi, our lot!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
Oh yes.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Don't exaggerate.
Who?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
And they want me?
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Is that you, Roby?
Kill drive engines.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
You want to try?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Take care.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
A voice transmission.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Yeah!
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Dead.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Damn it!  How long to fix?
What?
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
No, I don't want us separated.
Right. 
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
Ask him.
I'll come with you.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Can you do anything for him?
Should we go outside and bring him in?
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
We're not going anywhere.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Sandy, can you home in on that beam?
Dell -- show me that on a screen.
My signal's fading.
How far?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
We're going into the freezers now.
Let's get moving with this net.
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Well, it's finally happened.
Good!  Moisture content?
Any microorganisms?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Found what?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
By eating our food supplies.
What's that supposed to mean?
... More spores coming.
Kablooey.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Wait a minute.
Yep...
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
What's happening?
And?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
What's wrong?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Sounds great.
You've checked that end?
Looks like it.
What?  Why?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Phoebe.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I believe I will.
Just like that.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
D-day.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Frankly - yes.
All paved with diamonds and gold?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
No-no-no...
Why not?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
Then you've heard too.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Amen.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Show me a human and I might have!
I'm a junk yard.
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Twenty minutes!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Nothing, really...
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
Don't mix your metaphors.
Okay. Mix.
I'm trying terribly hard.
I'll say.
Margo, let's make peace.
Hear, hear...
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
Why.
Also Addison deWitt.
Everything.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
But she just got here...
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
See you home...
Hmm?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I don't care if I never get home.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
I don't intend to be.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
I'll never get over it.
I wish I could believe that.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
There are other plays...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
They're your fans, your audience-
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
Isn't that what they always say?
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
You'll be there, won't you.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve?
That's quite a change of subject.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Now just a minute-
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
They'd die without each other.
What are you going to wear?
Where is she?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
She was a revelation...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
The fucking New York Times.
Why didn't we get that?
When?
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
You want me to be the bastard.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--I know, I know--
--shit, who do we know?--
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
Goddamnit!--
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Any idea what he did?
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
We've just been talking to Young--
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
Give me your checkbook then.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
Just let me get a match.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
What do you want to know?
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
Go on.
I don't know titles.
Look, I told you inside--
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--can we use their names?--
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Sorry.
Single malt?
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Seduce her.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Neither will I.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm glad you think so.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
How did you know I was here?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
You can crash at Stifler's?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Right.  That gives us...
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Just in time.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
These are for you.  From father to son.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
I told you.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
So do I, Kev.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
You've got something going?
Okay.
Oh no.
You think so?
Okay, don't stop.
You want to do it?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
I want to hear you say it.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Qualify for what?
What's that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Once, in church, dude.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
He didn't?
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Dude, he does not.
Keep it down, dude.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Yeah. Apparently.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Serafine...?
A la votre.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Where?
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
Andy...
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Looks like he lied to you too.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Yes sir.
He says -
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Merde.
How to read.
I know, but I had to because . . .
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Who's Sophie?
You must have.
I shant!
What happened to your parents?
I have my reasons.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
How do you know?
Bartok... a question.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
It worked in Odessa...
I should go
Promise me she'll have her home.
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Why not?
Well, why not?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
How can you possibly oversleep?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Nice car.
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Don't be funny.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Well...
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Neat, yeah.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah!
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I dunno.
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
It relaxes me.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Following is different. I was spying.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Yeah?
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
There's a spider in the bathroom.
It was just great!
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Nothing at all?
Yeah.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
The what?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Step up here!
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Don't get upset!
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I can't.
Yeah.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Tell him.
Trigger.
Yeah, I love it there.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
I don't know, I mean, I-
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
M'hm.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Who's persecuting? She stole!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Yeah.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
A long time.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Absolutely.
Why last?
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
I'd say it was down.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
It's not going to come up.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
I love her too, Joe.
Damn straight.
Count on it.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
You have?
Nice to meet you.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Let me heal you, baby.
Hm.  We should do it again.
I love you, you're a genius.
I adore him.
There's still time to undo this.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel.
Hardly...
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No.  I missed that.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Really?
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
It's taken care of.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
That is not true.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Don't do this!
What?!  You aborted our child?!
You're not ready.
I'll never forgive you.
I guess.
Me too.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Don't be silly.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
No you're not.
Hm.
Very well put.
And you know, he really does not.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
You must have been a baby.
I like you.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
I'm sure you understand.
Why?
Not at all.
Oh?
Thank you.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Not enough.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
What does that mean?
I don't want to talk about it.
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Evie has a little something for you.
And here they are!
Would you like to meet my husband?
Yes.
I thought it was okay where it was.
So how much do you hate her?
And the food sucks, I know.
Not nice.  Not kind.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Divinely?
How should <u>I know</u>?
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Well I guess that makes us even.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
No, sir!
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
You're a real buddy.
Under the mat? 
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Care to make a small wager?
That's me. 
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Oh.
Cheers.
No -- I like it.
I think so.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Baxter.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
I'm not very good at it.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Pick a card.
A cemetery?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I just want some fresh air.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
A what?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
Over a girl?
That's terrible.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
What?
Fine. How's your eye?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That's very wise.
Of course not.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's very flattering.
What kind of joint are you running?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh?  Oh!
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
You too, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
I have a vague idea.
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
Let me get my bag.
Something like that.
It's regulations.
Aren't you?
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
I took sleeping pills.
No.
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Yeah --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Get out --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Call me what, sir?
No shit.
That we're dumber than we look.
Not a thing.
Where ?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Anyone got a cigarette.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
They must have seen the fire.
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
Well, he's killing now.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Do you know that jungle?
Thank you, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
What?
Six to eight feet.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Haiphong.
Who knows.
I met him.
Who?
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
No -- no, sir.
Yeah, I like it...
How's the pain?
I can handle it.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
I'm taking you back.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Yes, I know...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
When?
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Yes.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
I do.
Anyone got a card?
I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Needs patching.

Back against the bars.  Now.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
The radio's on the fritz.
Why?
I bet you haven't had lunch.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Wait a second.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
A daughter in Oregon.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
-- Turn around.
I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
You know Meyerling?
Too bad we're heading west.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
How many do you see?
Where's my ELT?
You got one?
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
You don't know how true that is.
You broke the radio, remember?
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Nothing personal.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What does this matter to you?
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
We were just talking about him.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
I love you.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Emergency room only.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
No!!! Stay away from me!
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Two days.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
What's that got to do with it?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Welcome.
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
I can trust my brain.
Go ahead.
Okay. Good-bye.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Stop staring. Do a vase.
What are you trying to do to me?
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
So am I, Frank.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
I'm not saying nothing to you.
About a dog.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Well, I can't reach them.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Come on, sweetheart...
Thanks.
This stuff is pointless.
Melvin...
I'm going back with you.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
What is this?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
No fucking way.
How long have you been freelance?
We both know what you were doing.
What?  What's okay?
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
You're too late.
Sure.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
The contract was stolen.
Know what?
One hour per man.
Where are we going?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah.
Turn off the engine.
We don't have a choice.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
What do you want to know?
It's not the same, is it?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
The C.I.A.?
How old were you?
You were like a boy genius?
Yes.
No.  Something honest.
You said you didn't trust it.
Thinking.
Nothing.
I don't know.
Why not?
Oh.  What do you think about?
No.
Okay.
Thank you.
Transmits and receives.
Fine.
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
What?  What if he brings it with him?
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
So?
How do you know they're not?
Why?
Are you attracted to me?
Why?
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
No.
What?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
It's a common question.
A dime.
Taken.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
Like you?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
What did the beer cost?
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
That makes you an expert I guess.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
'cause you stink of booze.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Have you ever stolen anything?
They'll never get us.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
Am I late?
Why don't we go together?
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
She's cool.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
That bad?
What happened?
Lucky break!
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
I'm not hungry, really.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
No, by road?
So am I.
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Yeah, maybe.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
What?
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
No way Doug, I can't.
No.
Thanks.
But I love you!
Sure, I've done it easily.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
It's not so much.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Yo, dobree!
Good, great....Dobchay!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
I had it coming from someone.
Sometimes.
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
No!
Not all of them!
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You may use my office.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
That's over. Way over.
He wants to show now.
Yeah.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
He wants to talk to you.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
Scamming's a strong word.
Later.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
What kind of a man are you, son?
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
-- This your idea of small talk?
-- Obviously.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
And you have to meet my father.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for something -- someone.
Yeah --
Belinda's a very jealous person.
And why would that scare me?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
No.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
What would you do up here?
Where's the one you're building?
No.
I will.
That's what I mean.
I was going to fake it.
Tired.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Yes.
It was a play.
That won't be possible.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
Your parents are divorced?
How -- how long does she have?
In there.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I'm no dummy.
For pay?
I'd work backstage or something?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
A similar triangle?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Uh, yes, sir...
No....
Seventeen.
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
No!
What drill?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Not a holocaust --
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Yeah,  Right.
Pro! Release the rope!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Marty.
A mall?
We don't....
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
What do you call this? 
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
No way!
What did you do to yours?
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Sure.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Is that right?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
Holly.
It's okay.
There you go.
Something mi trabajo.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Don't ask me.
What?
But it would hurt.
How bad off is he?
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I don't want a steak.
Positive?
I don't blame him.
I'm serious.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Yeah.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Really?
No.
Just gimme a chance.
New Jersey?
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Vanished. Thin air.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
It?  Who does?
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
What? How do you know that?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Everybody okay up here?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Which?  The one in my throat.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
You don't wanna know.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Please, Barton.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Hello.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know!
Hah!
I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Bill –
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Stop it, Bill!
...Who is this?
...Who?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
Ever act?
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Well I...
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
That's all right, really, thank you.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Seen a doctor?
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Mine have passed on. It's just the three of us now...
That's all right, really –
...Yeah, okay.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Charlie, I'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – I've gotta call the police...
Yeah.
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Yeah.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
All of which he's now missin'.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Only fry you once.
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
Thanks.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's been three months.
Thank you.
Yeah.
No, Nick, please --
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
What?
I know who you are.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
About a year and a half.
I don't smoke.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
She wiped out her whole family.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
You can make a mistake.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I'll meet you there.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Did you like her to watch?
Make love to me.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Come over here and tell me no.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
How's that?
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Routine.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
What is it you got between you?
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
Why the hell not?
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
Yeah.  I know.
What do you want?
Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
She killed him.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
On what basis?
Are you vice?
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Really. Huh. Too bad.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
What's wrong?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I know.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
You mean like an ape?
Who said that?
Out?
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Oh – you mean black people!
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
I ain't John Henry.
What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
I guess it was a long time ago.
I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
Party girls? Can I call you?
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
What's his name?
You only want one Big Mac?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Have a Mac.
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
What time is it?
I'll make you another one.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
Yeah.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I didn't know.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I will relay the message.
You'll never guess.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
I'm -- sorry, I --
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nor I, on the second.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Dad!  Save yourself!
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
No, just give you a splitting headache.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Too good?
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid to ask.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Definitely.
What are you talking about?
Kill her later.  We've got work to do.
From the other side of the equator-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Not good.
I find that unlikely.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I've got to stop him.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
He ran away?
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
What?
Mystery.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Big house. How many rooms?
Just checking, young sir.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
On occasion. Usually at night.
Wacko? That a technical term?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What?
Spare me the diagnosis, okay? You're being ridiculous. I can't be jealous of Batman.  Can I?
What are you talking about?
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Bruce, you can't.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
Fred?
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
You're a genius.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
... Murderer...
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
No one would miss me.
Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
WHAT?
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Because I want someone I can trust.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
What?  I improved her a little...
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
What were you thinking?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
Did you really ask?
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
Hi.....  Roses.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Honestly David, you're so spineless.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Annie, it's me.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Right first time.
Thanks, Annie.
Uh ... yes ...
Ahm.....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Ahm....
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Of course he is.
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Uh... Uh...
Me first?
Me first! Me first!
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Heh heh, thanks.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Deep and hard.
D.C., Chief.
Uh, Butt-Head.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Uh, ten uh...
No, Jane.
It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
I am sitting.
That's how long you were gone.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<u>You</u> left me.
That's all we need.
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Wait.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Maybe we should knock first?
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Who did the sushi?
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
We were trying to scare your mother.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Really.  I don't know.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
I got an A!
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<u>Out</u>.
We're...
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
No.  You don't want his help.
Our cemetery?
I think so.
Yes.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!

That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Why not?
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Any particular kind?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I saw some ghosts.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
Attic space.
Maybe Charles does.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
I see.
It's fine today, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Thank you, Robert.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... But he's...?
I have no idea...
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Yes.
There's no need for a hospital.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Your family doctor?
Oh? Certainly...
Yes. I lost my remote control.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
No. I like it here.
I am a very good gardener.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Hello, Eve.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Yes, so do we.
Good night, Eve.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Hello, Eve.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I don't want Robert.
Ben is very ill.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes. You look very sick.
... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?
I see, Ben.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Yes. I would like to do that.
I like to watch.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Good day, Sally.
I agree.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
I see.
Is his back feeling better?
Yes. It is.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
I am a very serious gardener.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I see...
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
But you won't sign, correct?
... Oh, really...
Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Yes, ma'am.
Look, Johanna...
No problem, Chief.
No, sir.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Please, have a seat.
Tell your friends.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
I'm a puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
What?
No they're not.
Yes.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
You bastard.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
The iguana?
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I'm sorry for everything.
You came up here looking for the portal?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Schwartz.
Forget it.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Yessir.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I wouldn't know.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
No.
What's he been in?
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You're evil, Maxine.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Hello. Wendy.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
No you mustn't, my child.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I love you, Lotte.
I have to see you.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, Lotte...
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Whatever.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
Not like He punished me.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don't be like that.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Oh.
Yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am..
Extra?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Don't matter. First time I'll be late in nine years. No great trouble..Whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time... don't matter...  The world is in this room, baby. This is all there is and all there needs to be.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
I don't know him that well.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
For what?
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
She was only-
Who is she? Where she come from?
All he can. All he can.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
She was my best thing.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
What do you think?
Oh, nothin', you know.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Yeah, it sucks.
Nothing.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
Thank you, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
That fucking bitch!
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Well--
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Yes, uh, very impressive.
I'm not really, uh.
He's handicapped, huh?
Nancy's pretty good.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
And was there anything of value in the car?
In the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
You're not interested in sex?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Now I got--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
MARK IT ZERO!
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Huh?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It's your roll.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
For Christ's sake, Dude.
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
But Walter--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Now Dude--
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Yeah.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Walter--
Who is this?
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Well. . . yeah.
Stay away from me, mister!
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
Impressive.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
I'll heal.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Not good.
Either that or feeding the worms.
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
I'll show you.
Then who does he work for?
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
So?
Thought you were dead.
Too bad you're out of it.
He was here.  Watching us.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Not that I'm in contact with.
Look, what's your problem?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
How can you be out here?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're blind --
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
It worked, didn't it?
Some. It's been slow --
I know. Take some of my blood.
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
What?
Sometimes --
Perhaps.
You.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You've been listening in the whole time?
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
--which she may have--
Join the club.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Trying to find the energy.
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
So whoever built this--
Not the only things missing, Nick.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Why is there no "our" here?
--fine, later, fine.
You said the name "James."
--you should get back into bed.
You have to go.
I want amphetamines.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
--coming out of the water--
--Cotter: shut up.
Too busy eating us?
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
No idea--goddamitt!
--Domini!
<u>What</u>--
I am.
I'm not finished.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
Asleep--
--oh, Jesus--
Enough to keep sane.
--shit!!!
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
Ancient runes--
You planning on sleeping out there?
Then I have no idea.
Okay.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Get some more beer.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
You're needed here--keep watching--
Anna--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
I am?
No, I--
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
See a guy.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Thanks.
I don't know. I better get off now.
...What do you mean?
What the hell happened, Ray?
In the trunk.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
What?
...Friday?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Back where?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
I didn't say that.  Well?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
For the money.
Got something to show me first?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Has Ray come in yet?
You said the usual--
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
What's the point?
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
For what?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Okay.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
If you want to.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. please. I won't.
What?
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
Yeah. hurry up though.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yes.
Beeeee careful.
Do you love me?
I did. are you?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I don't know. he moved away.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Yeah.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Oh yeah?
You like mysteries that much?
What is it?
... You look beautiful.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead.
Go ahead!
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You can change it if you want to.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
He what?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
What is?
Derek!
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Yeah.  She told me.
No fucking way.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Not really, no.
Because I got caught.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Slow down, George.  Slow down.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Okay.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Just sell it, Derek.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
We're half a million off.
Try the closet.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
What?
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Actually, it was three.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
Dad.
That was a beautiful message.
What about him?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
She did that before.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Better than you.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
You can call me Dad if you want.
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I don't believe you.
It's alright, Dad.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Who's the co-pilot?
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
That's right.
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
The strike is a success; but ...
Dien Bien Phu?
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Third group.
The NLF has condemned you to death.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Then don't complain.
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Cause?
A massive cardiac arrest.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Yes.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Counsel approach the bench.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
No.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
About a year and half ago.
Yes.
We were lovers.
Intense.
I had a bad heart.
She left me.
She didn't.  She just left.
Yes -- several times.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
No further questions.
You called him?
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Why'd you come here?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
It's only the beginning.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
No -- you're not.
Shoot him.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Yeah.
I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
Really?
I'm always open to learning new things.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Yes.
Why did you lie to me?
It was a place to start.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
SO!
I know. I don't understand it either.
He's not coming.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
I'll get right on it.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
I don't mind waiting.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Want another cigarette?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Oh. How old?
Must be nice having kids.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
I feel so embarrassed.
But I... We don't even know each other.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
No. I'll do them later.
Yes.
What?
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
What made you ask such a question?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, sure. Great.
Yeah. See you later.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Oh, how is he?
Are you hungry?
What?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
I sat outside and had coffee.
No. I couldn't.
No, I don't mind.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Yes, thanks.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Sure.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Frannie.
I'm going to miss you.
They're not going to find her!
WHAT!
You people really don't like dogs.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Spooked?
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
What it will be.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
You mean as opposed to your life?
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Who?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
You moved into this block?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Fuck it.  Alright.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Daddy?
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
It was just like in my head.
Potential toxic dump site.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
Should I?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Just admit it, Caesar.
Yeah, I know.
You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You understand?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
What are you going to do with it?
No!  They're still on their way.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
No.
Caesar, this is crazy.
What?
What happened to them?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
We're going to need some time.
Don't tell him --
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Sure, Gino, sure.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
No.
Why?
Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
Good guess.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
No.
Maybe.
You have to ask?
Basically.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
I think so, too.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Does the case lock?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah, twice.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
MPG Capital.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Really.
Okay.
I hadn't heard.
That'd be great.
Oh, Jesus... 
I want to go home.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
What?  Like amnesia?
Nothing.  It's just not there.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- there's no time --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.

We have to keep moving.

My husband's out looking for him.
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- he accessed the account --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
Thank you.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
I fixed it myself.
Machines don't fix themselves.
...sabotage!
... yer ducts.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
You don't have to sing it.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Beginner's luck.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Am I?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Very smart.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
We don't make mistakes.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Do you know what you're doing.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
Bastard!!!
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Who are you?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Well, no system is.
Well, terrorists of course.
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
Every day?
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Are you sure?
C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
You haven't switched it on.
I'm sorry but ...
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Mother!
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
But ... I called Central Services.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
What if there is no tomorrow?
Pregnant.
She's having a baby. Twins.
We are virgins.
Mary ...
Dead.
No.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Oh man, Bucky.
What?
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Okay.
He's better, though, right?
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
I need to sit down a minute.
He'll be all right.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
She's no whore, Marcus.
What's that, Frank?
That's too many.
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Yes.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
I've taken that into consideration.
Better bring it all.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Let me think.
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
No way!
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Oh, God, no!
They booted me out of Washington.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Call if you get weird.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
We can cut back at the end.
Not because you have to.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
No!!!!!
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I'll speak to you soon
Follow me.
Nobody else had it.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Okay, sweetie.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
It's not.
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
Fill for a second.
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
How are you at back rubs?
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Yeah?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Well, what is it?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Who?
Uh-uh.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Well, when?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
You want to come?
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I can't be.
Right back to you.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
Oh it's enough...
N-no...
I already told you I'm not.
Whaddya mean?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Now you're a professional!
Carla...
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Walter!  Jeez!
Hm...
Why not?!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Is it?  I've forgotten.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm totally serious!
When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.
Well, it all depends, Leonard...
Not only that, he copied us!
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Dead Cat?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
A parakeet?
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
I-I already got a new one!
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Yeah, why?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Uh, sure.
Hm.
Smack?
You are?
Walter shut up and relax!
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Really?
T-turned on?
Then let me give you something then...
Gee.  Thanks.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
I was just straightening up the place.
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
I had him in my grasp.
Litter, yeah!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Eeyuu.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
Hi.
I do?  I guess I do.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
Buffy.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
I'll back that up.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
China.
Lothos.
I have to show you.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
This is it.
All right.
It's true.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Who we gonna beat?
I had to test you.
Your turn.
Oh.
Try to pay attention.
Fine.
Buffy...
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
And where are they now?
Thank you very much.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Cassandra's really smart.
Thanks.
You're having a fling with him?
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
Could be.
Got that.
Oh, baby!
Jeffrey!
I heard she got straight A's.
Nee sitch.  No way.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Switch nostrils?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Nuke?!
Get over here.
I know what it is.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
What a nasty thing to say.
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I'm trying to play with your body!
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
That's great!
I think I'm ready for the Show.
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
Yep.
You got me all confused.
Who?
No.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
You got a live arm there.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
And where can I go?
Love to--
Ain't he warning up?
We're eight and sixteen.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
You were never my guest?!
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
I was in the building!
Yes, you were.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
Speeding?
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Hello.
Right away.
Right back.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Okay.
Matter of fact...
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
Somethin', huh?
Honey, come here.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Between...
Hey, Rich.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Hey.
I'll be honest with you.
Yeah.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It's none of my business?
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
What people?
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
Well...
No, that's quite all right.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
And they were usually right.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
Nice to see you, Senator.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
What is it?
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm not crying. 
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
No.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You can trust me.
What? What?!
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
What's it...
Pretty serious.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Let go of me! Let go of me!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
I should have -
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You get down here!
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
I'm not -
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
I really think you're -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Green?
So, you're a righty?
God! 
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
Mm.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Thanks, Nick.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Sam?
I understand.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Yeah?
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Great!
Oh.
I know.
What're you gonna do?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
That's enough now!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
All right?
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
I'll be there.
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
What about my money?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Get lost?
You are.
No, Lester.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
Here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
No, I'm gonna drive.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
All right.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
Yeah, what's to stop him?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
Fuck you!
Ch-Charlie M!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
I'm sorry.
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You are right. What can I...
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
We'll hunt him down together...
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Winning.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Why am I still troubled...
I got her...
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
You've seen me...
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Uh-huh..
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
Theo wants to talk again.
Then whose is it?
You could've killed us.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Allow me.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
Another minute.
How much time do you have left on it?
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
What do you mean?
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Why can't it be her?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You wouldn't --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
The money, Nels ... ?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
That's not good enough.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Keep talking.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Got a phone in that van?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
It's your call.
Talk to the man.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I won't let 'em.
Are you trying to panic the women?
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Put the girl on.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Stay put!  I know my way around.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
From here on, I dish it out.
Thanks.
She's not a girl, Col --
Yeah?
What would you call it?
An excellent quality.
I would expect he does.
Ask him yourself.
Hi.
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
Guy I work with.
The accent, I suppose.
Must be.
Yes, thank you.
No, I didn't --
They're jealous.
Like what?
How special?
Tell me about him.
Maybe.
Like you're concerned.
Is this an obsession of yours?
I'm thinking of your man.
What you doing here?
You think that's wise?
That's a start.
Sorry.
Delirious.
You gonna tell me why?
Not here.
I promise.
Sorry. What you doing?
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
I was trying to get out of something.
Only in times of extreme stress.
Did you hear me?
In a manner of speaking.
Stop it, Dil --
Got to be somewhere.
I like you, Dil --
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
It's my name, Dil --
Will I see you again?
The Metro.
Stop it, Dil --
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what happens then?
I take pride in my work.
Do you want a cup of tea?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
I told him.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Would make me feel better about it.
Just a girl.
Good. So what do you think?
Am I?
Can't we take it off?
No fucking way.
So I've noticed.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
And you know the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
Shouldn't take it personally.
And you play cricket?.
Give us a break.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Doesn't matter where.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
I've often wondered how you do it.
I told you not to talk that way --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
What you say, faster?
Hurling --
You don't know me, do you?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Tell me, Jody
Open up.
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
No!
Reggie -- listen to me --
No thanks.
You mean spies and things like that?
We? You mean you're --?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
May I have a sandwich, please?
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Because they're still here.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
That's not Carson Dyle.
Barely, yes.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
But no one actually saw him die.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
1944. The next face, please.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
No.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Oh. 
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
No.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
I'm sorry.
Alex --
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
I don't believe it.
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Go on.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
And if it is?
Meaning what?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
What do you want?
I don't know.
I don't know.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
No, Jean-Louis.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
I don't know where to go.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
What was what?
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
How about once more around the park?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Be careful, Peter.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
The man you had the fight with.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
We will separate -- you look over there.
I never fucked Rod.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
So?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
What's wrong?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
I thought you'd be pleased.
Run!
Are you sure?
She works at a church?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I can.
What?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
You think you're my sister?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
I was desperate. It was gross.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
What party?
I won't.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
Did Sharon say no?
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
That's not why we broke up.
You can ask me anything.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Are you Jody?
His mother's side.
I'm worried about someone.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.

Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
Any of them Richard Long?

You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...

INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Heat's murder.
Take it easy, Jake.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
I think I gave it to her.
Where from?
Would you call him a capable man?
That's too bad.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
No. She's probably scared to death.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
She's fine.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
I think I'll kill her.
Oh they don't?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Where's that?
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
Jake, listen.
I said okay, Jake.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Thank you...
No.
No?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
C'mon I'll show you.
I guess not.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
Well yes.
I have?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Did he know?
Where you were when your husband died.
That your maiden name?
No reason.
No. I'm just a snoop.
No, not for that one.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
What dam?
No.
What? What is it?
Why?
Doing what?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
It has to do with my father.
You saw my fa... father? When?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
You mean she just found out?
Aren't you coming back with me?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Katherine.
She's my sister and my daughter!
Where can we go?
He didn't wear bifocals.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
When did you come in?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Of course.
Oh, good.
And Mulwray isn't?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Yes...
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Who?
Mr. Gittes...
But...
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yeah.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You don't say?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Progress! It always arrives too late!
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
Elena. My name's Elena.
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
Somebody stole it.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
OK...
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
I didn't see that.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Enthusiastic?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
You know why?  She was so -
It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
That looks pretty nice.
Certainly not.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Yes, Mr. kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
Has he said when he'll finish?
Of course.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Hmm!
On the chiffonier.  Here.
You really don't know who I am?
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Oh, me -
I didn't say.
I work at Seligman's.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Half past eleven.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
You can't stop me.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Yes, sir. 
Can't say, sir.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
Good.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Go ahead.
What's wrong, Brad?
Why is she leaving me?
I know you will.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Sure.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Queer?
I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Rosebud?
Am I sure about what?
What the hell is that?
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
He went home to change for the big date.
No, this is great.
There's no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Awww. That was so cute.
Just now.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
No, you're not really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
But can we date?
I'm just kidding.
Like what?
Um... okay.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
Oh God...
Nobody. It was closed.
Yeah.
I can pass!
What's your point?
I thought Redding had like three balls!
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
No, thanks.
Why?
You called Caitlin again?
That's cheating?
She called you Brad?
Your mother.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Return of the Jedi.
There's more?
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And you figured it out?
Wait.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Each egg has to be perfect.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
The milkmaids?
Why not?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
What?
I'm going to miss the game.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Can we not talk about this?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Gatorade.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
No, you're not.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
If you go, I go.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Listen to you.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You work in a video store!
If you must.
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Could be.
This life.
Why do I have this life?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
I should shit or get off the pot.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
I don't have love handles.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I didn't strain. I sighed.
Yeah.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
Nothing personal.
It's not my store.
The difference is you exploit a weakness.
So.
He died in the bathroom.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
I'm trying.
So I'm told.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
How do you figure?
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
Twelve.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
Sure.
I don't want to go back with her...
Veronica, I love you...
What?
What's this?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
You said you were here all day?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
No way!
That's tight. Solid.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Twenty bucks.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
I admit, I can be bought.
Where's the radio?
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
My pleasure.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Sure you can.
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Just hangin' out.
We spent a night there one night...
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
Excuse me?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Call me sentimental.
Yeah?
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
This rope is sixty years old!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
Don't let me fall!
I don't know.  I don't know.
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
There is.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
It looks like a winding route.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Let's move your ass in there!!
We can't and he knows it.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
Impossible... I don't believe it.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Good evening.
And you, sir?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
I did, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Aye.
Oh, aye, aye.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
Murder, sir.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Lice?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Oh.
Yes.
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Indeed.
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Thank you.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
How often you go?
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Max...
In my office?
Yes.
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Pick me up in five minutes.
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
This isn't our goddamn game!
I've been calling and calling.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
What happens if you don't?
Who the hell is this?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
I'm trying...
I tried it.
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
What'd he do to you?
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Believe it.
Why?
I'm not catching a melody.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
She's in the hospital.
Jazz.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
Dmitri?
I don't get it.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
Why?
No.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
What'd they do?
Let her go.
Any special reason?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Just drop me off.
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Do you still ride?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I can't promise you anything.
What is?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
As opposed to?
What is it with you and the space program?
Do they have a secret handshake?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Never heard of him.
Getting rid of my hub!
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Is he dead?
Not this again.
You watch me, don't you?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
Okay, I will.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
This way.
Where are we going, Jerry?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Come on.
Did you kill my father?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
You saw me standing alone ...
You knew just what I was there for.
You've never seen her run.
I don't know...
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Only on the football field.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Terminal?
And what did I say?
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
I don't understand.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Not today...
Wasn't my idea.
What do you mean?
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
What?
I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
Oh?  How's he doing?
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Meaning...
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
What?  Why?
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Actually I'm running late --
I don't understand.
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Well --
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
Yavol.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Jesus --
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
It's really happening.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
If you came back.
Really.
I don't follow.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
Thank you.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I can't hear this now --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
I do.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
What is it?
Recommendations?
Git movin', I said.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
What are you doin' here?
Here, Mom.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Ram it in and break it off!
He's probably a gigolo.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I don't know, Boss.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
She's got him! You hear that?
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
Ah believe I smell me a blonde-haired lady.
You jes' watch us!
Borrowin'.
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
That's it. That's the end.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
Thass right. Just play it...
You just said he could eat anything.
Forty-five.
Cuter.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Kick a buck.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
What are you talking about?
No. No chains either.
Only kidding!
What did I do?
Fear of what...
When was the last time you washed your hair?
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Who was the man in the basement?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
You know I can't do that.
You know where.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Nothing.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Not yet.
What else?
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Over here.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
What about her arms?
Look at him, grandstanding...
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Shut up.
Right.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
You're damn right I do.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
Or the F.B.I.?
Give me Ruben back...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
And her husband? What was he?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
It does.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
One of your suitors?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Hard to say.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Really?
I'd have to see it on.
Truly.
Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
What's the matter?
I ruined your wedding night.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Mom, please.
I've already made arrangements.
Green spot.
I'm glad.
Letty.
By color.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Your family just met me.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
So, it's over?
I better make a list.
Open up.    I want to see.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
No.
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Yeah?
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Congratulations.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
What do you want to do?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
You just need to get more organized. L
I'm going to the store.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Especially this last year.
So, I've been thinking a lot...
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
So, what do you say, Let?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I love him.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I'll float you.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You'll never get out of the city.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
It's me...
C'mon, Laurant, America?
It's Daniel.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Yes.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I assume you want something?
Half the tapes.
How about if I call you?
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I'm not any closer than you are.
Where are you from?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Can I trust you, Sami?
You haven't answered my question.
What do you want now?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
What?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Hard to say.
You said don't do it, boss.
What'd they take?
Everything?
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Okay boss.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
I see.   A master criminal.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I'm not going to leave you.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
No.
No!
Yeah.   It's mine.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
How?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
I know where she went.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
Stick around and find out.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
A little?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I didn't have the heart.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then leave her to me.
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
So what if I don't?
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
What do you think?
How so?
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Kneel!
Give it back!
You coward!
Give me back my comb.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Fine.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
Have you questioned him yet?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I knew she would intrigue you.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
I'm buying.
No onions?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Fucking A, my friend.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
Who?
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
You don't even remember...
Does it hurt?
Shelly?
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
No shooting.
Annette Harrison.
I don't think so.
You might say that.
That's right.
You didn't show it to anybody?
No.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You did?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
A friend wrote me.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
It's my house.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
No thank you.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Who?
Doing what?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Wait, don't hang up.
What are you doing?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
Oh please.
I can't win with you.
That's not fair.
Get off me.
Hi.
What are you saying?
I love you.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Why?
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
You think he'll like it?
Just taking your photo.
I want to go home.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
I swear.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Some other time, Cecile.
Who is this?
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Racist piece of shit.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
I'm working on it.
Blow me.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
What's your problem?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
So what went wrong?
Where is she?
Oh yes.
I have a flair for drama.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
Get out!
I think you have your answer.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You will be discreet about this?
Do you know where she is?
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
I did?
How will I get to her?
You bastard!
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
How?
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
Yes, darling.
Oh, lots of times.
Do you know the people?
But it's already come true.
What's her name?
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Well, you know where it is.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Yes, I did.
Yes, daddy.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
It was on account of the birthday party.
It's true.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But...
You called me by my name.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Yes, Amy.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Look at me.
Anybody could know that song.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
That's from her -- that woman.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
I've changed a lot lately.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
I've been working out.
I mean where on your body?
Nearly four.
Does she have PMS?
What does that have to do with me?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
I don't know.
And she got the medium.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
Give him the tampon test.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
It is so hot in here.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
Tuesday. Are you okay?
What? Why'd you do that?
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
About Mark? Carlton?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Since when do you care?
It's Mark.
Yeah?
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Goodnight.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Interesting possibility.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
What about... those guys... I might have...
Thanks.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Oh my god, what happened?
How big?
Packages of money.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
Take some allergy medicine.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
We only live a few blocks apart.
The park dude was missing an arm.
This one walk you home too?
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
Just visiting my patient.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I see...
Why, yes.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
But I...
Wait, this isn't fair...
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Maybe.
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
Not that again...
We are...  living in their dreams...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
Don't worry.
Don't worry about it.
I promise.  I won't.
What the hell is this ?
No...
Great.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Fine...
Fine.
... What?
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
I was a senator, you know.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Are you out of your mind?
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Dave -- I'm working.
It's fine.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Extend things?
Oh my gosh...
I'm not sure... I might have.
I see what you mean.
Fine.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Why?
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
No.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Mind if I sit down?
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I don't mind.
Oh... Okay.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
... Me, too.
Yeah... It could be fun.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
We're working on it.
We're doing our best, sir.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
Gasparilla?
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Maybe.
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
No, sir.
Will do.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I don't think they're in school.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yep.
I'll tell you later.
Except sex.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
I told you, that's a secret.
But...
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Sure.
It's Nuwanda.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
But, Chris...
Huh?
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Are you going with Chet?
My Word
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
Courtyard?
A barbaric yawp.
Yawp!
AHHHHHH!
A crazy madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
You have another choice.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Todd Anderson.
Nothing.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
I guess.
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
This play?
I'll come to the performance.
We have to make it to the third deck...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
Then you better start swimming.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
Just trying to get to my boat...
Then who are you?
Jesus Christ lady...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Right... You have a boat.
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
What?
No...
Forget them...
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
I don't know...you got what we need?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Joey...
Nowhere...
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
John...
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
She fucked me.
Yeah.
Damn right!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
I'll get it! Where is it?
Vince thinks... you know...
Who? Who is?
It won't open.
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
You talk to him?
Where is he???
Linda, yeah.
Who's got the ammo?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Psst. Vince!
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Oh... You know...
I don't know.
No.
Up north.
Nick.
I want to go home, Merle.
So do I.
Yeah.
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
What do you mean, no???
That's my plan.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Yeah!
Naw.  Uh-huh.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Technothugs?
I can smell it.
What did you say?
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Your mother.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
I'm not voting for you.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
Telephone repairman.
Keep 'em busy.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
Doucet killed my partner.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Thanks.
I'll be okay.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
And you should be with your family.
Take a look at this.
They always are.
What's your name?
Remember, get the seat fixed.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
From over the mountain --
Jabez! Careful --
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
No, Stone!
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Some other time, Stevens.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
-- of what happens after we die!
I do -- and I think you should too.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Look here now--
I don't care.
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Yes -- at midnight.
Well, I --
Morning, Jabez.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Well -- yes --
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Oh, Jabez.
We can still use my butter money.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Jabez --
Oh -- Jabez.
I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
I am going to lock him up.
Isn't that your own fault?
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
All right, Jabez ...
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
I won't forget.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
It's okay, it's okay.
So, why didn't you come?
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Ellis, what have you told them?
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
I'm going to count to three...
I told you...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I still feel like shit.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
How do you know?
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
No.  I never smile any more.
Yeah.
Okay.
What about the kids?
Heidi, I'm dying.
They're not after you, they're after me.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
You're crazy.
You're really crazy.
Why you going to Algeria?
I know I am.  I know!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Call me whatever you want.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
... armed robbery ...
Sonny, come on out!
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
He's all doped up.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Come on, lemme load you up...
Mulvaney...
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
They look like good kids.
Why not?
What about Howard?
You were terrific, too!
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
You stopped?  Why?
Pure?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
Okay.  Which one goes?
I am.
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Maybe...
Doing what?

Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken. The fact that you made the choice to pursue this life- style... much to the chagrin of your mother... who is so clearly ashamed of you.

Have you noticed something about them?
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.

OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
I don't know how he does it.

Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
SILENCE... SILENCE.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Stop him, Jessica!
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
I don't understand.
I am always on time.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Nah.  This happens all the time...
Goulash.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
What?
You got the job?!!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Toss us out on our ass.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
You could say that --
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Yes?
Da pleasure be mine.
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Yes?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
I am.  How's your father?
Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
Yes!
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
Isn't that the same thing?
At what point?
Who?
Yeah, so... ?
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
This is real, Bananahead!
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
This guy.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Yes?
Mm...  Oh, man...
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Oh.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could've been a nurse?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What's the matter?!
But Al is your husband now!
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Shari, Ray feels --
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Dynamite.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
I know, I ...
... yeah, then, but...
Come on...
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
...yeah?
No... Could you?
What?
What is?!
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
Screw off.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Save it.
Me?!
Me?! That's you!
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
No problema.  You want a picture?
Hi.
Oh, man! So...
Do you still have it?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Yeah. Why?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
pierdo.
pierdes.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Thank you.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Dick... Dick,..
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Looks like today's your lucky day
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Yes?
Doing what?
I've got an idea.
Take as much room as you want
You will.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
I did it.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
Still clear?
Three twenty-five.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I don't care.
For what?
Yeah.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Yeah, plain scotch.
Are you sorry she's dead?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
It's Lynn.
You fuck for money.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
So tell me about it.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Of course... But how?
Look at a picture for me.
No!  Please leave!
Let's just kill them.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
Which one are you and which one am I?
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
I got her address.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Susan Lefferts.
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Clean?
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I never truck with no sissies!
Dogs got no reason to live.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
And now you'll provide them.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
What about you?
What?
Just don't shoot me.
Give me a minute, will ya?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
What?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
Of his penis, sir?
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Bud White's been here?
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Right now, before I back down.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
What's Dudley's scheme?
Officer White?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
I just called it.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Showbiz.
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Oh Jesus.
Be careful, Danny.
Told by whom?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Who are they?
You're crazy.
It's a SAT-tracker.
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
We said a hundred.
One-twenty.
I called from a payphone!
How do you know so much?
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Jesus.
Why'd you leave?
Looks like Detroit.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Yeah.
Where?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
No.
Well then who can?
What are you saying?
Law enforcement?
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
I can't.
Because I don't know.
No, sir.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Just for the criminals.
Right.
Something bad happened tonight.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
No.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Was that doctored-up, too?
Stacy--
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
It's a brand new card.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I don't believe it is, no.
It tastes like fish.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
You have to.
I <u>did</u> care how.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
We believe he did.
Seat 74.
Brill.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
What are you talking--
Really?
Did they take your clothes?
They only took electrical appliances.
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Into what?
Bobby--
Why would the NSA--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Go fuck yourself.
Bobby--
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Fuck you.
Get it.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
What about the tape?
And if it wasn't?
What's your ETA?
No.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
I don't care to bargain.
Excuse me?
Her or me?
Pardon?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
No, but I think I do.
Good.
Now.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
What?  No!
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
What?
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
Don't talk.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Still a car.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
What?
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Thank you.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Don't cut me.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Are you Hana?
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
Where've you been?
I liberated it.
She can take you as far as Florence.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
I see.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
Oh really?
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Apprentices.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Are you crazy?
Because I'm a nurse.
Yes?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
I've been told that before.
Never heard of it.
I love you.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I try not to expect you.
Kip… I -
Then come with me.
Hello miss.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
How awful.  What will you do?
I don't think so.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Bingo.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Who am I?
Uh. I'm showing off.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I sincerely hope so.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
We go underwater?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
That's because I wanted them to!
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
It was perfect.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
It was a long time ago.
Charged?
Thank you.
Little celebration before we set off.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
Ready.
Got it.
Behind you.
Shut up.
What?
Yes. Yes.
A billion dollars.
Hold the record. Alone.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
Transfer.
It's no good without the argon gas.
You've thought of everything.
Like a woman of mystery.
Charged.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Call it a new tradition.
You can do it.
Get out of here!
But--
What about you?
My god--
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
You gave them the eight billion.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
It better be worth it for me.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Probably not.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
They did?
Wow.  Why would they do that?
The what?
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Any school you want.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
If you hadn't used profanity --
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
What, you think I'm made of money?
Erin --
Erin --
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
And that's what caused the contamination?
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
You didn't care about my case?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Erin --
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
What do you mean?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
It happens all the time.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Well I hate it.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
You got a little girl?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
How?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Fixing a leak under your sink.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
I'm just saying --
Keep your voice down.
What's that?
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
What's going on?
Yeah.  Who are you?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
And that is why I must go.
Okay, okay.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Sit down, and shut up!
I'm going to see what it is.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
Now you're making sense.
What is it?
How do I look?
Yes, you do.
That's quite a compliment.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Thanks to you.
No hard feelings?
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
... we're the bait.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
I thought you knew this person.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
Why not me?
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
No!
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They look pretty docile.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
What?
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
I got a new deal for you.
I see your point. What's the favor?
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
It's history. I gotta go.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Looking to get out.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
You're running out of time.
I'm looking for somebody.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah.
I cannot--
...I saw nothing.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Of Merlin?
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
Speak of the devil!...
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Your mother told you that?
I'm going.
Not you, my husband?
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
You, my lord.
No.
I'm not jealous!
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
That I cannot.
People make you laugh?
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
You didn't ask!
Fuck it.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
In here!
Hi, how'd your day go?
No kidding.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What didn't he tell you?
Of course I didn't.
Me too.
No, she was heavily sedated.
We still don't know.
No. Not at all,
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Of course. Have you got a pen?
What's her name?
You're a nice man.
No thanks Karl.
Fine thank you.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Depression?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Never.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Yes am.
No.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Could you see her?
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
In Europe.
No.
Yeah.
Here I'll show you.
Captain Howdy.
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
I don't know
I don't know, I just thought.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
So what's wrong with her?
What's playing.
No.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
You and us.
Uh Huh.
In time.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
No.
Amen
And let my cry come unto thee.
And also with you.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
She'll go into coma.
I've seen him.
Sick priest, is that it?
Yes?
Are you a relative?
Just a minute.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive!
No.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
You bring trunks, Jack?
How many?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
How's the birthday girl?
Recognize these two characters?
Out.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Jack...
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
It's more than that.
You'll see.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I don't know what you mean.
It never was.
Let's get it over with.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
It's early.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
It's not gonna hurt you.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
Here, how's this?
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Yeah, fine.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Two years ago.  March.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Right.
Okay.
Good idea.
Right.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
Doesn't it matter to you?
Two hours ago!
Huh?
Celebrating.  Join me?
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
He was just having fun.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
I can keep the beat.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
All right.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Well, that's fine --
Right.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
That's the premise.
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Time for what?
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Big feet.
Right.
I said I was sorry.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
Virgins.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Uh ... thanks.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Yeah.
Black.  Labrador.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Nothing personal --
No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
Hey, business is business.
Better than that.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
He called her.
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
I've given it up.
Hi.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Another five years, huh?
Eddie did.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Good to see you, Ma.
He's losing his teeth.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
Only one you've never broken.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
And you wouldn't be.
One last time.  It's important ...
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
What more proof do you need?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
What happened?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
You can't blame me for trying.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
Have fun at work.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great.
Oh, that Karl.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
I don't know.  Maybe...
I’m sure you do...
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Where’s my real dad?
Five thirty.  Okay.
That’s where you work.
Like what?
Kate’s my wife...
Pretty much.
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Are we what, Jack?
It would help me if we were.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
All in one tape?
For us, Kate.
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Uh huh...
You’re kidding me...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
...my feet are hurtin’...
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Really.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
You had a heart attack?
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
Zeena...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
It’s wonderful...
What are you talking about, Jack?
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Are you okay, Jack?
Promise me again...
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Do I know you?
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Of course I did.
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I'd like that, too.
Merry Christmas...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
This makes five.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Go back to the drawing board.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Last one down springs for room service.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Johnny.
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
That's what we're here to find out.
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Raising the shields.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Message to Proteus.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
I'd hold that off awhile.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
But I did. I'm positive!
You can't --it's too dangerous --
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
That's what they pay me for.
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Oxygenation...
Then why not take it?
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
At an operation?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Well, we better get on with it.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
Two in a row?
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Where we going?
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
Look at those Walls up ahead!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my daughter?
Unghh... oh, geez...
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Certainly.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Yeah.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
What the heck d'ya mean?
GOT IT?
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
You have children?
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
Oh, man!
Yah, right -
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
You bet.
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Good day, sir.
It's okay, Scotty.
Okay.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
...Who they playin'?
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I know it's a lot.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
We might be innarested.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Ah, dammit!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Mm.
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Yah.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Yah...
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah?
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, no, that's fine.
No, I didn't...
His wife?
No.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
They're real good.
Yah, ya think?
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Congratulations, Jerry.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Yes?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Should we?
I suppose.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
It suits you.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Good.
Chloe's dead.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
Can I come in?
Answer the question!
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Who's this?
... You know me?
What?
Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Now, find your power animal.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
No, supply oxygen?
...no ...no ...
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
Is it?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
No, I'm not...
We don't... ?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Hey.
What should I have told you?
You know what I mean.
What are you doing?!
Why do people think I'm you?
And, sometimes you control it...
This isn't possible...
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
I can't let you...
I'm not going...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Paraffin.
Proceed with remote detonation.
Why what?
What have you left for me?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Yes, it is.
How'd you know?
Please, God, no...
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Signs?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Carter.
Blow me.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
How do you know?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
I know how it feels to be dead.
No, I'm good.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Sure.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Thirty-nine.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Easy, Billy, just open it.
I don't.
You're the fuckin' devil.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
"Next?"
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Design?
No harm. No foul.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Huh?
What just happened?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
No.
One hundred.
Where's your stuff?
Exactly.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
American?
Alright.  Home run.
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
I thought he was with you.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
How?
Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
Have fun.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
American.  Come to get you out.
Am I out of here?
Those men are all dead.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Do I look like I have someone special?
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
I was attacked.
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
Thanks.
No, it's not... Come here...
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
I'm a man with a mission, Jack.
It was a crime.
I... I was just leaving.
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
No, I have to work.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes.  They're free.
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I'm the one what?
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Funny -- you look married.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
What are the other reasons?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
You advise us!
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
It sounds exciting.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
You're playing the other side.
You treat me like I was.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Is what you?
Who said I was depressed?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
That's good.
You know who it once belonged to?
Don't tell me about this...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Where's Catherine?!
Bye, Robert.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
I didn't have any.
Shut up...
That's what you said?
I'm fine.
What?
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Yes.
Is she?
Thanks, Carl...
What?
At game, Carl.
You're all full of shit!
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Jesus, what a rude person...
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Hold onto this.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Look at me.
Then don't go out with me.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Of course.
Just chill.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
You look good.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Pitt.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Which one?
She lives near Eddie?
So, then whadda ya want?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
That's Babar.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
There is?
Like tonight.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
My lawyer was a bum.
Wait a second --
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Velma.
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Where are you going?
You sure did.
Right.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Fletch?
Who?
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
They serve dinner on the flight?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Deal.
Don't say shoot, okay.
Not me.
Not our kind of people, you understand.
That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Cute thing.
John Ultrarelamensky.
Please.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
You are a rich woman.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Here, take mine.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Depends on the question.
What is this?
How do you know about that?
Gail, please.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Come here.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
This morning.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
I want something I can print!
Not really?
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Who?
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
But I am...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Johnny's C.D.?
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Why are all these people after me?
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
There's that question...
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Doyle.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
I wasn't looking.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
S'right.
What?
Yeah, I know.
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
Policy man in Queens.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I can't.
Let yourself in.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Pour it in your ear.
Hiya, Jesus.
Well, I think you do.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
You alright?
He ain't the only one.
I'm serious.
No.  This isn't what you think.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy, I'm scared.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Hello?
This afternoon?
What'd you just say?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
What's happening?
I'm thirty-five years old.
I think I'm losing you.
I never knew you, Dad.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
Something happened, something...
She's not here.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
John, he's got my driver's license.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What...
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Yeah, that's right.
She's pretty special.
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I hear that.
You have the right to speak to an att --
Where are you going?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Barely.
Chuck... look.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Will you come with me?
Why?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
What?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
It's deceiving.
You promised you'd never ask me.
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
My whole world.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
Don't say any more.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
It's just beginning.
What's it to ya?
Wait a minute. I just...
I hope so.
I found it outside.
Who ya calling?
Boy scouting.
Yeah, we're here.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Yes, but they released me because...
Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Okay, I'll call you later.
N...nothing.
Okay.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Yeah...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
-- Bad?!
Never.
What are you going to do?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Nothing.
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Walking corpses are not real!
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I'm staying.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I don't know what to say...
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Yeah...a lot.
There's something I haven't told you...
I gathered that.
It's not that simple.
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
We changed our minds.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
What do you mean???
The window...
Is the ship going to sink??
Where you're going, mister?
What did you find?
Very bad today.
I don't want to hear about it.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
Do not inhale.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
I say we go.
Don't wait Efor me.
Then you should carry a gun.
Where is it?
No, we're not.
Paisley Porter.
Yes. What are you implying?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
Our Peter?
About what?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
That's completely crazy.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I'm not sure.
Daddy, wait.
Mystery. Deception.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
Two-all after six.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
Who the hell cares?
Joanne Bourne.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Washed away.
What did it say?
I'm at the door.
Pop, will you let me in?
Right here. At the door.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Since when did that matter?
I lost it. I lose everything.
So what are you going to do about it?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Because faith is rewarded.
Why do you care?
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
hat was this morning.
How come?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
I was educated by nuns.
I have excellent long-term memory.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
A little drastic maybe?
Alla puttanesca.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
Stop!
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
You will respect the law.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Thank you. No.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Grudges?
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
Blood.  From the vein.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Often.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
Jerome--?
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Any particular reason?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Michael's.
You may as well invite her here.
Not bad, Jerome.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
I was at home.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Stay clean.
Beynon.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
It looks fine.
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Fatter... some things never change.
After four years and now the question comes up.
I'm still here, Doc.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Suit yourself.
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Want to cry now?
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
He might be ready to chop us up.
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
What do we do?
You bastard...
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
I mean it.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Let's do it.
Not now.
No scars.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
You and me.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Yeah... I guess it does.
I'm good at that.
Whatever you need.
Aren't we going a little hard?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
How about twenty thousand?
How long have you been married?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I'll tell you when.
Was the steering faulty?
Yes.
What name?
I can't Jack. How can I?
Doreen.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What?
I work for him.
Go on.
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
So where are we going, Princess?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
We're there now.
Brumby.
Especially when I play the lead.
Not entirely. No.
Sure I'm sure.
You've been watching the film.
Yeah.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Nice of you to come.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
At me friend's house.
What?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Large Scotch.
My brother, Frank.
I'm sorry.
No. Really, I am.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Ta-ra.
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
How'd you know I wouldn't?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
It would be. If they were still living.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Piss off, Ray.
I have to. Things to see to.
But they have to be diplomatic.
The gun he means.
No.
...they hold on to their money...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
Eh?
No.
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
Eh?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
He is?
I heard that they were running cold.
Yes.
That's right...
You...
When they...
What?
Yes...?
How?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
For five thousand?
You're saying "me."
What?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
No.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's right.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
That's...
...what am I going to do all month...
What?
To the cops?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
No.
No.
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
You understand?
No.
Thank you, George.
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Could I...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
You're done, come down, and let's...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...you didn't close...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
What two?
...let me...are you listening to me...?
Yes.
I can't do it, Shel.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I can't split them.
Somebody broke in.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
It's not impossible.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Was it?
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
Fuck you.
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Last night, this morning.
Like you taught me...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Uh...
Oh!  For the magazine...
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
I don't know.
Gimlet.
Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
Three days.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
She told me I have to.
What does that mean?
The power to negotiate.
This.
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They didn't get my contracts.
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Yes.
I got lots of presents.
No, where is it?
That's right.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
How are the kids?
I saw him with you.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
No, Dad.
He will grow strong.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
It was hard to have him killed.
What do you want me to do?
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
I've always taken care of you.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I'm going to see my parents.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
That plane goes to Miami...
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Twenty-five this time.
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Did my brother go back?
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Goodbye, Michael.
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
Very impressive.
How is his health?
Yes.
I do not.
When do we talk?
You were unfair with them.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
And?
Sitting right behind you.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
We got no choice.
Weird.
It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Your wife?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No!
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Nice place.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
What?  Oh yes.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
No.  I'm fine.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
I'm not, you know.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
Not at the moment.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
What happened?
Do you miss it?
I didn't --
You're the one who started it.
David produced her last picture.
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh Clayton.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
Ooooh.
I think I'll hang around.
Have a drink?
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
You only embarrass yourself.
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Elsa?
Just go.  We can manage without you.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Of course.  This afternoon.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Six years ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I don't want him hurt...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
One more night --
What do you mean -- ?
You got no choice. It's over.
Let them go --
Get out of here, then. Now.
You know my back.
A little family emergency --
Kip.
Consider me gone, Detective --
Not at all ...
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Donny-nothin'!
Hey, Donny --
There's no one left ...
one minute -- !
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Hello, Memphis --
You, too
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
About what?
I can handle it --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
Otto called -
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
The family that steals together, deals together...
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Nah.
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Now, we go -
Run it...
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
For real?
Call 'em here -- ?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
And Tracy's on the move ...
How is he -- ?
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
She left...
Look at Jeannie's kid.
No more shines, Billy.
Wha?  Me?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Liar!
What bag?
I can't do it anymore.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Where's the stuff?
You what?
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
Paulie was just talking about him.
I gotta talk to you.
Yeah.
You're some fucking jerk.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
No, no. It's okay.
Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He's with his friends.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
What? Come on!
Suck my cock!
Stop crowdin the plate!
What are we gonna do up there?
No, and we got four of 'em.
I don't know yet.
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
No, I had to talk him down.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
You could put a pool in that backyard.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
I think so.
Half-red, half-black--
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
Since Nancy died.
Not at all.
I live right around the corner.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
--Gerry--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
--I don't have any anger at you--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
What's the point?
I don't got a crush on her.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Like what, Will?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Have you read all these books, Will?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
Haven't called her.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
That's right.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
I don't know.
What?
Define that.
Yeah.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
What?
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Not far from here, South Boston.
You know, nothing special.
Not a chance.
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
Some, a little.
I guess so.
Like me?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
I can't go out to California.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
You're *ticklin' me!*
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Joad.
Two.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Which way is House 25?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Say, who runs this place?
Why ain't they more like it?
Crate fell on me.
Goodnight.
Have a little snort?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
What you figger to do?
You're right!
Thought you was in jail.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Yeah.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
This here's a strike.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Don't taste bad.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Granma's dead.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
I don't understan' it, Tom.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
There, them stripy ones.
But who done it?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Won't they come out here?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
I wisht it was day.
Man bones?
Morning.
We can pick anything.
Yes I do.
I'm Martin Blank.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
It's nice to see you again.
I'm a professional killer.
Okay.
Yep.
Bad people.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
What?
We haven't seen each other since high school.
--She's not dead---
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Yes.
No.
It's something I do...
Get the fuck outta here.
Jesus Christ!
You never could have kept this from me.
I'll hide.
What stuff?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
Excellent. Here they come.
In Portugal, yes.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
Yup.
He using her.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
That's going to cost.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I'll do it tomorrow.
I've looked at it.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
It's a place where religious people--
Jim?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
That's too bad.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
What's that to miss?
Does Chicago count?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
It is. It's lovely.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
How did you find out all that?
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
I won't ask you to.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Annie!
I don't care! We'd be together.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
What about him?
Mom?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I don't care.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
I think they call it a pasture.
Hi.
You're right. Good.
Did you go riding?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
Yeah, you know everything!!
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
What?... Oh baby...
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
So do you.
All right. Speak to you then.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Okay.
I love you.
Yeah.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
Why?!
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
What do you mean?
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
I understand, but Annie, please...
It isn't right to make him suffer...
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
You!
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Yeah.
We should be fine, then.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
Sure.
What does that mean?
So?
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
No, not yet.
NO!
I know. Amazing.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
You just showing off for her!
You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
Oh yeah...
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Hackers of the World, Unite!
The sensitive type.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
That's far out!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Go fix the phones.
Curtis.
Mm-hmm.
Revenge.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
That's bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
How did you know that?
Burn!
Okay. Let's go shopping.
We did it!
Yeah! Sure.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
What?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
You're not gonna win.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
I'll hack the Gibson.
Yeah.
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
What?
Dreams?
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
My name is the Plague.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Hey, it's me.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
555-4202.
Thank you.
We've been better.
Not without Jamie.
Go!
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
How many people in the bus?
Outside.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
I don't want to.
Yeah, hurry up.
Dad, what's going on?
All right.
You knew. You just didn't care.
I don't want to look pushy.
Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
Jamie?
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Right here, Ben.
This is 132, over.
What are we doing?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
He's here, Sheriff.
It isn't a man.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
Be here in a minute.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Thanks.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Just answer the damn phone.
Michael's around someplace...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Have a good time.
Sure.
Why are they under there?
There is no such thing.
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
I saw him...
What is it, Laurie?
I'm scared...
I killed him...
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
A lot of works.
And then, uh, April...huh?
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Yes.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Really?!
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Hi.
Yeah?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
I'm...all right.
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Bye.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Oh, don't say those words!
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Oh, all the time.
No.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Are you in love with someone else?
Always.
It's on the table, Dad.
Mmm...
Because he likes you.
Yeah.
They're in the basement.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
I can't take this anymore.
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
I'm sorry.
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Hello?
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Why?
No.
How are you?
Really?
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
He's fine.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
...you know?  I, uh...
Football!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Oh, sure.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Oh, yeah. 
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
You got it.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
How?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Really?
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Hmm.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
...which I did not get.
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
I'm going to tell you later....
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Now, whyn't you help us?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
They got that kind of money?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
Exactly.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
...what's he got against you?
You seen John Brigham...?
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
I said sometime it gets so...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...how so?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
...yes, yes, yes...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Spoken like a Protestant.
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
...not to turn around.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
What shape is the scar?
Hey, lost again.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Or clear your windshield with it.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...would you use a small word?
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Yes.
...why?
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
Because?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Say Hi for me.
You're all making me blush...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Goodnight.
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
Yeah. And?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too."
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Because you're an idiot.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
I didn't. Cherry.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Like a suicide thing?
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Next channel, darling.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Remember he's left-handed.
Of course.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
I thought I...you..
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
May<u>be</u>.
Get a job.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Thank you so much!
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
Saint Mario!
Him . . .
That . . .
You mean travel by ourselves?
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Yes . . .
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Bull...
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Well?
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
Where's Allison?
Gwen, my wife's dead.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
What?
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
No please make yourself at home.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
What?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
YOU!
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Try stupid.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Right.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
You mean John Bubber?
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Lie, you mean...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
He's pretty... remarkable.
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
What about?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
How are they with kids?
Okay.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Uh huh.
Holly -- that's not so.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
What's that?
Stop knowing me so well.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
What?
What?
Huh?
Oh -- great.
No.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Fuck you, Philip.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
What about cable?
I didn't.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I have a cold.
Can we keep him?
It's a double.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise.
Talk to me about what?
I'd like you to see this.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Lieutenant.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
No.  I don't scare easy.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
If it came down to it what would you do?
No.  What am I to do?
No -- I will.
No -- after you.
Can you really tell from doing that?
I think you just like to eat dirt.
Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
How?
Why not?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
You're twenty minutes late.
I know.
Yes -- it is.
No.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
And the other one -- he is like you?
Get out.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
What?  How?
We'll see.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
It will not end tonight.
I know.
I can take care of myself.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Me too.
Yes.
Why?
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Yes, sir.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
I'll make the call.
It's happening right now.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
I'm here.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
My father.
You can't run with suitcases.
I overheard him with the girl.
Okey-doke.
I don't eat junk food.
What do you mean?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Where is it?
You sure?
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
He said something about a girl --
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Go, Mickey.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Are all of you named Jones?
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
Not until the man calls.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
We're okay.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
They're still in the house.
Yes.
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
What do you want?
You can let go.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
These disks . . . where are they?
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
What do you mean by that?
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Let me see your identity card.
There is nothing to it.
Name a price.
And four children?
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
I can't, I don't have the men.
What did they say?
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
No, sir.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Listen, you need me.
Politics is power, Paul. And money.
You have no whiskey?
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Fuck you.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
Promoted. House Manager.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
The third floor are low class rooms.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Please, be quiet.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
It will do just fine.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
But who is left?
What for Paul.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
In Ruhengeri?
Why?
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
No! Sit down now.
What sort of plan?
Anais, it is so good to see you.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
Why?
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
How dead?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Many beers.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Thank you, Roger.
Where?
Can I help you?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
And what's Steven's status?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
I'm moved beyond words.
Ms. Marr!
As a tumor.
-- fuck you!
And I think that's case --
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
Did it work?
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Over here!
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
Why?
I don't think so...
No...not air --
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
It'll have to do.
He's dead...?
Jesus!
I hope not.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
Question answered.
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
No, no, it's just --
What?
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
He must've unsealed the room!
Over here.
-- I'm coming --
It might have been her mother.
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
Good-bye.
That poor little girl.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
We're going to go someplace new.
Where is she?
My God, I heard something!
Good night daddy.
The place is pretty dusty.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
I just, I don't know...
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Are you ok?
Thank you.
Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
What are you getting at!
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Runic?
Well what is it!
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
So where is it?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right.
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
That's great.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I'm trying to quit.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Would you know this store again?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Fuck you!
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
C'mon.  It'll be great.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
I laughed, I cried.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Why try?
You sound disappointed.
Anna, I think you better stay....
I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
God go with you, sister.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Never, why do you ask?
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Prison?
Oh, I'm so sorry...
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Like a "cat", one could say.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
I guess that's a no.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
What job?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Too bad.
The Hudsucker Hoop!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
He didn't offer you money.
I myself --
Oh, no, really, I --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Now, Aim --
Norville!
Sez who?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
I don't know...
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Watch it, Archer --
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Tell me about it.
This I know, Benny.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
I --
Well, I --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Yes sir...
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
I --
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Get out of my sight.
But, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
Old Faithful.
...Her mother needs an operation...
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
You mean a figurehead.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Thank you.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
It's my day off.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Wait. I want to listen.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes, thank you.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Good morning.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
Yes.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Why?
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
And as usual no one believed me...
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Hmm. Good night.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Nothing.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
A key party?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Well, we can talk about it.
We were just riding around.
You're not a psycho!
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Yes.
That's right.
But not too ashamed.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Do what?
Am I right or am I right?
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You going to tell dad?
The Idiot?
What is it?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Tell Sandy? What?
Huh?
Yeah.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Can I come?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
What are you doing?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Communist Viet Cong.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
I had him!
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Then change it.
What?
That's right.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Seven years.
What are we thinking?
I'm always all business.
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
After that she left the party to go to him.
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Yes down at the station.
But she was an attractive girl.
Did you have sex with her?
But you wanted to.
There's nothing more to talk about.
No back-up.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Nothing if not vampires...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
Listen to me.
If you say so. You are innocent.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
Yes... My God...
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
What night? What do you mean?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Don't mock, Claudia...
And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
Not yet.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
How devilishly clever.
Be still!
Why should I be?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Sure...
Dying?
I want a woman.
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
It can't be...
Do you think so?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
That's all past, Lestat.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
I tried...
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
You're not lying to me, are you?
Yes.
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Can a vampire feel love?
He did it to make you stay with him!
How could I not? She had to know.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
No...
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Is that bad?
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
No.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Don't even think about it.
Some.
Just kidding.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Why are you being like this?
You know me to well.
Wait, it's Nancy --
It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
It's...him.
It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
He's in it with Willis?
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
I don't know, but I'm starving.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
How much?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Not anymore.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
What is up with that weirdo?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
Drunk again?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
In case you do so, would you --
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
She has never mentioned her family.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
That your father and I ——
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
Oh, now —— now look here ——
I can't understand that.
You are my friend.
It is for that he hates me.
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
I hate to do this, fella.
Yeah, very funny.
Suicide.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
It isn't me!
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
That's your problem, George Bailey.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
George Bailey.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
All right.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Well, what happened to you?
Will you try to get some sleep?
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh . . .
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
I'm all right.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
No.
Oh, George!
Don't hurt my ear again!
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
He's pretty young for that job.
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
Nothing.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Right down here.
George . . .
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Have you made up your mind?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
To keep from being an old maid.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
Left them at the office.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Back down!
I hope that's the cousin.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
We better go back in.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
The Shark.
You bet.  Hang on....
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Happy to do it.
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
What camera?
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
I kind of had plans....
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
What else you got?
Is that what it is?
You don't make enough.
The Shark's mouth.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Damn.
Do you?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Just one minute....
Mike's out there.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
Someone has to do something.
What?
You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Sure they did....
That's you.
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
I will, I will.
Help!  Help!
That's a crock of shit.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
What the hell is it?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
No.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Quiet!  Shhh!
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
And a missing man.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
See you later.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Just put your mask on.
They just wanted to say hello.
Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
Yes?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
It's a shark's tooth!
It's all controlled from the Control Room.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
No, no.  That won't do.
No!
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
They still seem nervous.
And big for his age.
Not good enough.
He's missing.
... Massachussettans aren't.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Why you sonuvabitch...
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
It's disappeared.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Five hundred yards.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Sharks???
I want to see Kathryn.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
But you always let me....
Nowhere....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Because....
It went away....
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Spent it all on beer....
You have something to say about everything....
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
He heard that.
You can stay in my room.
It's not nice to be evasive.
I'll miss you....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Come on, I'll show you around.
I'm fine....
Good.  So will I....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm fine....
There's nothing to worry about....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
No one does till they learn....
Nothing....
A big one....
You'll be sorry.
That's hard to imagine....
You're always taking time off....
You got a better idea...?
Good news travels fast....
What's that....?
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Still chasing fish?
We'll be done pretty soon....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
The readings suck....
Put me down....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
When we got the grant....
So did I....
Lots of times....
So far..
Maybe it's gone....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I'm going down, Jake....
You don't like my voice...?
Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Here it comes....
I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Anything to do before I go home?
What?
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Only me and Mom ..
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
Not too good in daylight ..
Because, don't get into it ...
I already did. What's his problem?
Maybe?
How'd you do it, old man?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Pay me, and I shut up.
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Are you sure you didn't call?
I'm going up to the institute.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
Once.
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
My hands?
I don't know.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
Really? What did he say?
He said that? What else did he say?
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Okay, this is working.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
-- stop --
There is something missing here.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Bill, Rod, wait --
My son... my mind...
No no. I knew.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
We are?
I just got goosebumps.
Hi.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Do you have something to drink?
Good idea.  Thank you.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Happy. He said "happy?"
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
What?
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Why do you love me?
What --
You want...
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Thank you.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
Said who?  Sugar?
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Great word.  Towel?
No, I'm saying to be --
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Forget it.  Forget it.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Good deal, man.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Go.  Flee.
I missed ya.  What can I say?
Well.  Good luck with that --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Not a chance.
Don't be silly.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Dick.
You'll lose.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
I'm not your brother!
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
I'm scared.  What is it?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
This is how you play God.
What is it?
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Nothing.
Just drop it Paul!
Eric!
He's this way.
That one time was just the bumper.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
You couldn't have made that jump.
He loves you too.
It won't hold!
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
I don't think so.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Baryonyx?
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Really?  What do you do there?
A well-accepted theory.
In Costa Rica?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Something must've scared them.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Come on!
To collect my fee.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
You've broken its leg!
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Piss.
You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
No.
Why did you come here?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Funded by whom?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
How would we cut off the lysine?
'Bout thirty seconds.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Shhhhh!
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Oh my God.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
John....
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
The - - agility.  You're right!
We're out of a job.
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Okay.
Anti-nature.
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
What are we looking for?
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Listen, ahh - -
Tim, are you okay?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Yes it is.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Nope.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
You have no idea.
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Why?
I didn't say I was scared.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
What kind of opinions?
We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Wu?
Who?
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
John, John.
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Sure.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
You have a map.
Who is this? What's going on?
What about that other guy?
He... he's here...
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
So?
Insomnolesence...
Not yet.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
-- Small.
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
In a manner of speaking.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
I'll commit that to memory.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I do.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
No.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Why were you given notice?
-- Listen to me --
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
No, I suppose not.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
... A piece of paper ...
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
Now Ann ...
Father ... Father!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
We're leaving.
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Native costume?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Yeah.
She was with you after she left Frank.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Yes?
Don't belong?
Sorry. 
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Here please.
Will you let me go then?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
No, I'm look --
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
What about everything since?
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
No.
You said you wanted these.
I don't see anything, do you?
And I don't think that was Tom.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Not much point to this, is there?
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
I don't get you.
I don't like getting splashed.
What?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I better keep looking.
It's got to make sense some way.
Yeah.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
What's in it?
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
I wanted to give it to you first.
All right.
I've just got a few --
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
She told me.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I looked it up.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
What else do you know?
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Not particularly.
Soon.  Very soon.
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
I guess...
Uh huh...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Oh...
It's my name too.
No, she never did.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Why does he decide?
I don't understand, daddy.
Overruled.
Yes, your honor.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Yes.  Very much.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Objection!
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Yes.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
What?
Yes...How's Billy?
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Murray.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Fine.
Six.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I understand.
I'm sure.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
A moment.
Again?
Can I do anything I want?
And you have horses? You love horses.
Here. We'll collect them.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Yes.
Then, we shall meet.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
How many?
I accept it. What is suffering?
No. This war is almost over.
I do not know, Holiness.
When it is time.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
No, Holiness.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
What would you do, Holiness?
It is a difficult situation.
Oh, yes.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Thank you.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
I coulda shot you, you--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Get the gun.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
That's actually the easy part.
You talk to Bickerman?
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Are you sure?
I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
Nothing's real.
Oh, bullshit.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
They could try to tranq him on land.
We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Excuse me?
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Night.
Alright, Jack!
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Did he say anything?
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
I'm sorry.
You like Jack?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
He said he knew Karate!
Look.
Wait.
Absolutely.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
A tooth?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kelly--
Wild guess.
Kelly--
Shitbutt?
Why not?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Sometimes.
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
I understand.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Starling -
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Murdered...? How?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Starling -
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Sewing...
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
I never thought about it.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed your patient?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Was it a butterfly?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Early. Still dark.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
Yes...! They were screaming.
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Dr. Lecter -
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Let us go, miss.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Yes. I want you to go.
...never doubt what you are doing.
When? How?
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
And by sea!
"Some"?
Yes. Yes, I will.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What the bloody hell plan is this?
No.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
What did you see, Major?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
The decision is final.
Fire!!!
Yes sir!
Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
La victoire.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
I'm not a doctor.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Can you fix it?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Has it helped?
How much time does that give us?
Where's Jones?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
It bit me!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
What's your air reading?
Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
...and a Russian grandmother...
It...almost got you.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
He's tanking on us...
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Let's hope it holds.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
OK, open the gate.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
. . . What?
You will what?
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
I want your bar.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
At what, exactly?
So?
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
What do you mean?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
So?
They stole our land--
You really want to know, sir?
No, sir. Not at all.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
He'll live.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
Sergeant?
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
So is Buddy on your short list?
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
You little pissant--
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
No sir.
That guy who got shot--
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
He's still pissed off about it.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Dad--
You wouldn't?
Cool.
Made some money, came back here--
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
Lead mine.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Maybe.
You could take it--
That ring--
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Bandidos, Injuns--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We have a daughter.
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Do you?
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Steve?
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
And when my father was Sheriff?
What was your deal with him?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Well, you were working there--
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Amado.
He hates me.
Yeah.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Pilar--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Just doing my job.
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
What's up?
So when did Buddy leave?
Uh-huh.
doorway) And who's that?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Knew what?
Right.
That's so cool.
He's a priest?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
About?
He's with us... He's with us...
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Why?  Because he had you?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
It was more than that, I think.
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
I told you --
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
And they all came...
Quaid and Jennifer--
Hang on!
Harry...
I'm here, Harry.
I think so.
Harry-?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Somebody killed him.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
What about Swann's miracles?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Mr. D'Amour?
You know of him?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
A ticket home,
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yes.
I tried to pay you off.
What?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
I did it for Dorothea.
I don't know what else to do.
Will that do?  No?
Yes.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
A couple of weeks.
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Oh.
Philosophy.
No way.
I know. I don't either.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No, yes, it does...
That's ok.
We established that we have no communication.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Because that would be too easy.
How old is she?
Yeah, look at that thing.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Yes, no.
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
It's just carpet.
Is there anything I can do?
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Do you want to- 
Tomorrow.
Bye.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Sure.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
It's nothing.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I think I should join you.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
He will.  He has great faith.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Father, I'm right here.
How many weeks are you honey/
What's his name?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Peter, please...
Please, the children.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
What's the...OH SHIT!
What?
I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
Not a lot.
Whish the circumstances were different.
We need all the help we can get.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
You are the younger of two...
Get out of here.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
We millionaires yet?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I don't remember that.
That's ridiculous.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
The blue.
Oh, sorry.
Huh?
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Get used to it, babe.
Four days.
Why not?
To do what you love.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
No one's forcing her.
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Oh, great.
Yeah, right.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just not my type, I guess.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
Uh huh.
I just can.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
I don't care.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
For how long?
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
He ain't Spalding.
None of your business.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
You do see me standing here, right?
What?
My court, I go first.
Plan to.
Right here.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Quincy...
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Hey, what's up.
Cheap date.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Uh huh.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
No.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
you woke me up to tell me that?
For what?
So you're gonna bitch up?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Business folks.
What's that, not great?
Nona, please.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We were just studying.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
What mess?
Your door was unlocked.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Came by to check on you.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Brain and Lung.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm coming!
No one else in there with you?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Who was it?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
-- do you wanna cup?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Good bye.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Well...is that illegal?
Really?
Bye.
...yeah...
I'm sorry --
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
That was so great what you just said.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
I want a shot of tequila too.
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Sorry, little man.
I'm a rapper.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
What's up?
Well --
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
What?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Don't do this, Don.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Where is he?
When was the last time you talked to your son?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
It's ok.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
No.
Graduation?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
Not really.
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
-- fuck you.
people die.
Not a problem.
Right.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Yeah.
What's this, how did this happen?
I went out last night.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
For 25.  Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright --
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Yes.
How long with Ellen?
How long with Paula?
I really don't know.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
I'II go....is it...back here?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
No they don't --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
I'm trying to help, Linda --
You need to sober up.
Hi.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
818-753-0088.
Water.
Yes. What? Yes.
What do you do?
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I need this one.
Love you too.
You're late, not me.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
I don't know.
Yes.
Hi.
It's not right.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
That is good.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
A body.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Those can be adopted --
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Forgiveness?
No, not Louis!
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
Perhaps this will help.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Raoul --
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is its antidote?
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
And you never knew why?
Phillippe.  Rest now.
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Get out of my way.
What was the end page?
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
Sire, I --
I... we are humble people...
You would do that, your Majesty?
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Alright, stay on the phone.
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Fine...
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
I'll live...
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Could explain why Fleming was there.
He said he was following up some lead.
Who is it?
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Up north.
You're the mysterious type, right?
No...
No.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
I killed them.
What else is new?
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Not with this...
Did you have sex with her?
Where is he?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
What's the bottom line?
Could he handle a direct contact?
How are Molly and the boy?
As long as they're dead...
I know...
Why?
To recover the mind set.
What is it?
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
'Changes?'
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
What?
How far away's the back-up?
It's me.
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No!
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
I'm very scared.
I don't know...
Yes.
You'll let me go now?
No.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Thank you very much.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
And you said?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
I have to see somebody.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Will? Are you okay?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Will?  You could come up here.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
My name's Will Graham. I...
Yes.
We don't know that.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
You read about it, I'm sure.
I hope you have a second chance...
You got it.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
But wasn't it funny?
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Yeah...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
I'm here, ain't I?
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
I can shtop whenever I want...
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
They're gonna lynch him!
It's my name.
Know what?
Hurry!
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
Two grand.
I don't know... My computer...
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
He's going to pop!
How many were there?
Go.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Yes.  Now.
How do you know all this?
The agents --
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
For what?
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
Because... I didn't think I would?
She would say she knows enough.
Yes.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Shit, I'm sorry.
I'm not the One.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
What?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
We can't leave him!
What choice?
I'm coming with you.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Because I believe in something.
Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
I'll be all right.
Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
I don't know.  I lost him.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
That means it's good.
Ok.  Wait here.
Be careful.
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
'And with your spirit.'
Yeah.
Panther!  Same thing...
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
No, she isn't.
Wouldn't bother me.
I don't like loading crates.
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Ok, how's everything going?
No.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
OK, get in.
C'mon Johnny.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$20.
I know.
Chinese food?
No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
What do they expect you to say?
What was it?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Wha?
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Here.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
But...
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You could say that.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
You think so?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
He's coming.
He's cute.
Hi, Allison --
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
No.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Of course.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
I thought you were buying my company.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Am I not obligated to?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Why yes, thank you.
Of whom?
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
'Yes' to the deal?
No no, not you.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
As close as a deal could be.
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I don't care.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Joe, you do get around.
Yeah.  Neat.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
'It's up to Joe'?
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Good morning, Jennifer.
What?
Yes?
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Love.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I haven't.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I don't have any.
Yes?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Yes.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Yes.  I'm tired.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
And you can't tell me who you are.
It gets worse.
Don't.  That will come later.
'Love will find out the way'.
It's a saying.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
'Threw' you?  Where?
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
I won't.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Not at all.
It is a deal?
I understand.
Oh.  Okay.
This part I'm interested in.
I guess...
Just a manner of speaking.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Yes?
Say again?
I think you heard me, Bill.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Well, they're mine now.
I don't expect you to.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Get him in here.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
'...Yes --'
You fill the bill, Bill.
Speak up, please.
Then don't.
I'm sorry, I --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
I'm here.
Watch it!
How's that, Quince?
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Sure.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Hi, honey.
You mean like you loved Mom?
What were you going to say?
Bravo.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
Yes, but --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
That's it.
I'm sorry... um... ?
Then why is this my handwriting?
Hi, Leonard.
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Interested in buying one?
Quiet!
Take the money and walk away!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Don't remember.
Kill him.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
And what did he say?
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Get rid of Dodd for me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Thanks.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
What are you here for?
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Thank you.
You're in a playful mood.
I don't remember.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Probably left it in your room.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Fucking hope not.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
That, and your thing.						   *
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
It makes all the difference.					 *
You can't just take it!
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
I was the kids' godfather.
"And" what?
He any good?
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Recruit us to do what?
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
It goes very fast.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
No.
That's right.
Zero risk.
Twenty-eight-point-five.
Do I need it?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
I know.  And now?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Port-Au-Prince.
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's your Miami PD badge number?
We don't know.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Have faith.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
Goodbye.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
He did volunteer one time...
Meaning...?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Sure you're all right?
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
You like it? Take a look.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Don't say nothing about you either.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
I'm wet.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Uh, yessir.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Getchmis...?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
We go through the wall?
Ziat!
Shit.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Sixty?
Not far. Just a little way.
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Something like that. Cigarette?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
How long?
Section 13?
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
You know where it is?
Oh shit.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Mr. Yesil.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
Yeah...?
Weird shit...?
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Go!! Just go!!
Nino, please...
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
We?
No.
It didn't bite me.
The scent won't last...
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Your arm, you can't...
Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
--my number one fan.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
The phones are working?
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I can live with "great."
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
I DIDN'T...
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
No big deal.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I don't know.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
I can't write this anymore.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
...have to wait.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
It's perfect.
I think you're right.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
What?
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Be my guest.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
It's good you found it.
Buster.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Did they win?
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Oh, I am.  Later..
And you're happy about that?
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
..or hard wired..
What are you talking about?
Then we got'em!
Right.
And the check's in the mall.
How much longer before you can reach him?
No.  Should I?
Oh, either way works for me.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
They've got a book for everything.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
And six billion in the world.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Then feel better!..
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
Good job.  And thanks.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
You're right, of course.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
All ten million.
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Sure...
What about you?
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
Always.
Give me a break, Pops.
Higher.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Very well.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Yeah.
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
And a lonely ass.
I always check the batteries.
No, I'm going.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Very good.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
And that's how much I'm saying.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
What's your news?
You did this once it didn't work out.
He did?
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Let's go tell your Mother.
What'd you do to your hair?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
Good morning, Lucy.
You have too many dogs.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Let me come and talk to you.
I'm making you a steak.
Loretta.
Just Johnny.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I was dead, too.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
What did you do?
Oh no I didn't!
I can't do that!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Awful?
I think that's it.
Yeah. It smells like snow.
I know what I know.
Why?
No.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Hi.
I shouldn't.
On the floor?
Alright.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
A month from today?
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
If I marry you my mother will die.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Where you been?
Everything's different.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Definitely!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Sure.
Yes.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
What? What?
Oh.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
You see that moon last night?
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Yes!
...What?
What do you mean?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
The Britons.
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
We want ... a shrubbery!

Oh, please!
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
My liege,  I am honored.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
What does it say?
A G...g...g...
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Be quiet!
Come on, patsy.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Farewell, Concorde!
But, Mother ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Listen, Alice ...
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Leaving the room.
Yes?
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
The Prince ... ?
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Seventy a year.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
I'm getting dressed.
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll be worried about me.
You know nothing about her!
I can't move to tidy.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
I hope to go up next year.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
She's busy.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I wouldn't know.
The greasy pole.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
What?
What does he know about the Highlands?
That doesn't make him an expert.
Yes, ma'am?
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Then why send me back to them?!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
So?
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
No, indeed.
The same, your Majesty.
Just them?
What is he doing there?
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Again?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
How do you do that?
How'd you know it was us?
It's the game, ARCADE.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What the hell does that mean?
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
I'm in the middle of it...
You imagined it.
Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
And beat it at it's own game.
What are you going to do?
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
What?
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
And then keep on driving?
Yes...
Then we'll go home.
Of course I am.
Sign me up.
The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
Howdy to you.
Whatever.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
How's that?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
But you won't.
No. I can't.
Diane?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
I'm not sure about this.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Where at?
Making ends meet, huh.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
I don't know.
I'm working on it.
I'm leaving.
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
I'm listening.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
Is this really the time ?
Fine...
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
Ow...
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
When will that be ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Son, let's watch the tape.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
What did you hear ?
I was.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
What ?????
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
How can this happen ?
Thank you.
Do you want to go out with me ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
What the hell kind of cop are you ?
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Me, I'll know!
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
What boy likes you?
Her favorite poet.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
No.
Oh.  Ohhh?
You mean, you knew about me?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
More than anything in the world.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
I never met my mother.
You're over reacting!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Change my name.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
And I thought I was weird.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Give it to me!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Nick?
Part adventure...part miracle.

For the mini-bike fund.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
They're great.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Yes, it does.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Sounds like you're very organized.
Phil for God sake.
Oh...what's that?
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
There's plenty of fruit.
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Yes, I do.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
You're telling me.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
But Dad'll never go for it.
He is?
Good for you baby.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Yeah, all right...
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Yes.
No.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Deceased.
Pardon?
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Okay, sure.
It's nice.
Are you mad at me?
Is there enough room?
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
What?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Oh come on.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Will you tell her I came by?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
We'd love to hear it.
Yes it is.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Thomas?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Oh great!!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I will I promise.
Uh huh.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Oh no!  UUH.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Come on, it's fun.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Duck!
So?
I am running faster!!
Really?
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
But, I don't know how.
Well, let's spit on it.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
Would you think of me?
I should look different.
... weeks.
We're about to find out.
No, he's ruining yours.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
He said that, too.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
I just don't want to freak him out.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
It doesn't say th...
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
I need you.
W...
Such as.
She finds him "personable."
Till the gas ran out.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
What, leaving school...
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
I got the point.
Like I said, dazzling.
If you like.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
Well, it happens.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
It's two weeks.
That's little egotistical.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
You're much more his type.
I see.
You're so good.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
She's going to rest now.
Oh, sure.
He knows better.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
President.
ABC.
D.C.
Sure thing.
Okay.
It's the den mother.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
She's in Paris.
Your brother?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
I'm not really a musician.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Bye.
Linnea?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Hi.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Wow!
You sound different. Is that really you?
How much?
Hello.
How long have you been together?
Just a minute.
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
You always live there?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be dammed.
Sure thing.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
I see.
More or less...
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
Yeah.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Thank you, sir.
Susanville, Soledade.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
How 'bout Manson?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
She doesn't talk?
Don't worry about it.
Then was it worth it?
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Yeah, we have a van.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
NO!!!
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
And a snake-eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Yes.
Just for fun, I guess.
Thanks.
Yeah, sure.
Perfecto!
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
How so?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Lose 'em.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
And me.
Don't call my men assholes.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Okay.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Well, what d'you know?!
I'll smile when it's funny.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Like where?
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Oh yeah?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
No thanks.
You got a problem all right.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
'Been up north?
No.
What d'you mean?
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I'll see you later.
What?
You didn't answer my question.
Uh-huh. Why?
I don't want to hurt you.
What about your boy?
We can always do that, Duff.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Yeah!
What d'you mean?
Like what?
Yeah, see you in hell.
Wouldn't have known you.
Okay.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
I heard you.
Great.
Better get him to a hospital.
She'll do.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Sure.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Okay, boy, beat it.
What's the matter now?
Since when?
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
You son of a bitch...
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
It hasn't yet.
What's he doing to my gear?
Prepping your trip.
I find out now.
Can you read my mind?
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
It's Case. Remember me?
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
All things possible in Babylon.
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Can you walk?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Nobody has.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
How long, Dixie?
Less than thirty minutes.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
No!... No...
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Couple of months.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
So you're a wire junkie.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
Put the gun down, Case.
Case...
They'll cut you down.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
I'll be okay.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
You're out of time, man.
Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Yes, it's lame.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Nope.
Roger in Op/Ed.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Anita!
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Hidden camera.
Sometimes opposites attract.
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Do I want to be crunched?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
A flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Oh. Right.
Have you been to any parties?
They hid my car--
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Yeah, you gonna be there?
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
And a gymnast!
Thanks. And what are -
wasn't even thinking about-
I-
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Thank you.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Thank you.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
Oh--yikes!
Well, are you here with anybody?
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
But now you don't have to--
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Nah uh.
Who are you guys?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
No.
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
It's getting there.
Who's Lisa?
Oh, come on Dad...
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
How come?
I know.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
What's this?
What do you mean?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Oh, Jesse...
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
I'm not hungry.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Hi.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
'Morning, honey.
Huh?
You okay?
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I thought I'd wait for you.
Can't it wait till morning?
They're healing up nicely.
I gotta stay up, Max.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
To old friends.
He's real.
Sure.
He's heavy in the halls...
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
I think so.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Fuck off.
Why is that?
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
For what?
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Your dreams?
No.  We're alone.
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Me too.
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Really, no.
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Hi.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
Hello.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
That's fine.
She saw through me.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
No, you were brilliant
This is the place.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
You think I should do Henry James instead?
No.  What's that?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Miracles do happen.
And this is William.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
... get fired.
He's cooking guinea fowl?
In a depressingly asexual way.
Yes -- sort of...
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Shame!
Working with Leonardo.
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
What's your name?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Can I help you?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
No, it doesn't.
I think you do, yes.
No -- did you?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Is it someone we know?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Point taken.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
No, 'fraid not.
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
No -- you're right.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Yes.
What?
So?
What book?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
I was in luh-love with her.
Will you come with me, please.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
I wanna report a robbery!
What for?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right!
Go on...
No way.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
A vote is before the group.
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
M-M-M-Mack?
God Bless America.
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Yeah, Mack?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Right, Mack!
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Me too...
My feet hurt...
What?
A pecking party?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
With your own two hands?
Just warmin' up.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
No!
I just started!
No!
I'm not running a charity ward...
Gary Blinker...
Me. Hit me!
Hold it a minute.
No. Me! Me!
Me too! Me too!
Hold it!
I see.
I see...
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
'Kay, Mac!
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Shhh!  This way!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
What?
P.A. What the hell is that?
Big man!
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Huh?
Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
No way...
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Is he one of the loonies?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
No, she wasn't my sister.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Your hair... is perfect.
Exactly.
Your great aunt.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
No.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Right now?
Hi.
What?
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Yeah.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
In that case... no...
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Uh huh.
Yes?
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
So, what's your point?
He's a podiatrist or something.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Only what?
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Nothing.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Sure you did.
What?
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
I meant about my idea.
Like a detective.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Is Damon Bradley here?
What if he doesn't like me?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
Kate.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
You miss me?...
Right.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
That's really romantic.
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
Sure we keep records!
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that— he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
It's a living.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
I don't know— I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I could have been better!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
None of your business.
Which side are you with?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
Oh she's a beauty.
I don't know.
What a fruitcake you are!
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Listen— get this straight— don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Terry, what's wrong?
You?
I just told the Father.
What I did to Joey.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Well, it's over.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
He wanted to see me again.
A question of who rides who.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'—
Sure... .
You'll work.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
I told you lay off.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Looking for me?
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Take it easy now, Terry.
First things first.
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
Listen, Johnny—
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
Keep Charley out of this.
One of these days.
I do not joke in my proposal.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Where?
I'm not sure...
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Maybe so.
Of course I do.
A situation easily remedied.
A symbol, Master.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
Ahh, she will be yours.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
I will decide the conclusion.
I'm so frightened.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aaarrrgggaahh.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
He didn't want me to.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Yes.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone's probably tapped.
I'm a tourist.
Uh-huh...
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
Yes, she did.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
I don't know.
All you gotta do is get in.
It was an unusual experience.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Call and tell you.
Wait.  You not Adele?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
I could walk out of here.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
That's right.
Another C.
Let's go outside and talk.
I thought everything.
Someone down here?
Not until recently.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
I thought so, too.
Faye Dunaway.
Nothing.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Really.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
You won't do that.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
Those guys bother you?
It's not a game.  Something you play.
I don't think we should get into that.
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Five point two.
For a time.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Gimme another hint.
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
Thanks.
He said he stayed here last November.
Your dog was killed?
Something better.  Open it.
He's still married though, huh?
Oh, he's moved out?
What're you doing at Glades?
You used to like it.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
I didn't have time.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
I don't have any idea.
Like a fag.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Where the fuck is Foley?
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
He was that good?
Red...Strange?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
A m-missionary?
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Good shooting, Rafe!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
You were more like brothers.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
How did you?...
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
I'm not telling.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
I can't. It's all too much.
Just what you underlined.
Charlie...
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Refresh my memory.
Maybe I blocked it out.
They'll learn to live with it.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
I have to talk to you..
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Right here. Now sit down.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
It opens, too. Look inside.
I'll never give up.
What would that be, sir?
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
It must run in the family.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
I can't do that.
I hate chickens.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Doing some shopping?
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Please don't shout.
How do you feel?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Oh. I forgot.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
For what?
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
It really wasn't that difficult.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Give me some credit, will you?
Wbat're you talking about?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Did you break up with Charlie?
Wait! I'll go with you!
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I suppose so.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
It's been a few years.
Sure.
I'll be fine, Dad.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
Yeah...
What do you mean?
Go later...
All the time.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
Bob...
K-R-O-one.
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Of course.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
He's upset, he's sorry.
I have AIDS.
One week old.
Little baby girl.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
Fine.
What?
Not bad.
Let's find you a drink.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
Do you... pray?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What kind of person is that?
No. I didn't.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Something like that.
Not unnecessary ones.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
No.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
I'm fine.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Thank you. No more questions.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Why are we going to do that?
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Aren't you?
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Yeah... ?
Night, honey.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Helloooo...
Andy, you don't want this.
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Lookit. Lookit!
<u>What</u>?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
Look deeper.
One or two.
But they...they could still be....
I would try for them.
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Probably right.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
You know who Muhammad was?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
What?
Please...this solves nothing...please....
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Looks clear.
Just realized that, huh?
So which one caught your eye?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
What, it's broken?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Right now, if you like.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
And they fell out of the sky with you?
It's probably wrong --
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Let's find them all.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Don't bother
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
I'm for that.
What is it?
What?
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
The Hunt Club.
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
With one of them.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Okay.Up to the cave.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Why not?
We can't.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
God bless you.
Yes, Sir.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
No... I move faster alone. 
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
I really don't know.
I don't know.
I'm supposing.
Not tonight.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Would you mind?
Why certainly, baby.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Whatever you say.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
No thank you.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
That's all there is.
Bad enough.
That's putting it mildly.
Quarter after one. Why?
All right--following me.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
No percentage in that.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
That's right.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Magruder does.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
Do you think I was faking?
You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
The police always do, don't they?
There isn't anything you can do.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
Goodbye, Betty.
We know everything.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Who's Goble?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
Sometimes.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
Doesn't answer the question.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Would you?
Go live in a tent.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
Open it and count it.
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I'll know when I find it.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
I think so.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
Pretty big chance, huh?
Oh nothing.
Positive?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
How about Magruder?
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Yes, sir.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
What are my orders, sir?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
It's fine, thank you.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
We'll see you next week, and if--
I will, thanks.
Well, we were just...
Yes.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
Hello.
...break away completely from--
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Freshman and sophomores...
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Who?
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
To the airlift.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Come on.  Hand over.
Let me see.
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
Suez.  1956.
Next time tell her I've gone away.
Yes, you said.
Yes.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Voila!
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Zero distortion, sir.
A little mushy.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The shit they pull, huh?
The fucking punks are surfers.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
I saw it.
It's been a long time, General.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
What's that, General?
There's something else, Major...
Hawkins?
I think it's Hawkins.
There's no sign of it.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Twenty-five percent.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
No.
Who indeed...
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
For an hour.
Why?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
... dollars?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
What?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Any good?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
You're forgiven.
Television?
Please.
No.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
He's good at what he does.
Shall we mingle?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Shush.  Of course you can.
Where are you taking me!?
I more than liked it.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It was a business decision.
Vivian...
Oh, god, what?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Why?
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
In Beverly Hills?
Where do you fit?
Dummy.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
What?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
But what if they serve soup?
Steak spoon! 
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
I just might do that.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
It never happened.
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
How many could you handle?
-- what? --
The body?
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
Right, right, sorry.
Yeah. It's really good.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
I don't understand.
As you wish...
Sire.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
Who won? How did it end?
Of course.
Yes.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Light him.
-- offer me money --
-- power too -- promise me that --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Are you a rotten liar.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Nothing comes to mind.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
You're sure nobody's following us?
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
"Honeymoon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
I'll wait in the hall ...
Ooooooops.
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Do the books!  Do the books!
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Come on.  Let's get going.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Very nice girl.
We can't play today?
Oh, the best one.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Bismark...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
I mean in show business.
What do you do best?
Send for Goebbels.
We won.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Anyone at home?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Money.
Must've needed it.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Of course not. Please.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
A lot?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
May I talk to you?
I want to know if my sister is here.
A good reason, I suppose.
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
I hate tears. 
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Sam, I'm going.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Why not?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
I haven't even been married once yet!
Sam, let's go get married.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Uncommon, too.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Maybe you saw Mary!
He's already been.
Haven't any.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Did she talk?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Who are you? What is your name?
You--a friend to me?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
You found Buckley?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
I'm going to call the police.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
You would.
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
So that's the way it is?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
Thank you.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
The body of Joan Gale!
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
You mean he was colored?
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Get out of here.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Now don't that call for an extra!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
We'll grant that.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Almost certain.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Dad...
You did miss --
Where to?
That's the physicist's playground.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Well, some fiend might.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Am I hurting you?
Good night, Rose.
I said I wouldn't.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Okay.
Boy! Wow!
What are they doing?
What are they doing, Doll?
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
A wonderful woman, boy.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
No, sir.
Got yourself up?
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Tennessee?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Galley proof.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I don't mind.
You're not gonna see him again.
What and?  That's what I got.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Thank you, concerned citizen.
What do you want me to do about it?
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Stop blaming yourself.
I got him.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
No, but it should.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
No.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There'll be other chances.
Where have you been?
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Murderer?  Really?
It's our job.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You know... you could say thank you.
Absolutely.
Don't crowd him.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
Sounds good.
I'm well aware of that.
Keep 'em busy.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
His lightsaber.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
Yeah, she's comin' up.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
That's all any of us can see.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
I don't know.
Hold me.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
All right, hang on.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh, no.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not fight you.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Oh. Well, yes.
Disintegrated?
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Yes.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Makes you cry
Like I'm outside in the rain
Oh no no no no.
...I suppose.
It doesn't bother me either.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, I do.
I think he might be worried.
It's fine.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
What?
Could ya take off that hat.
Yes.
Don't want weak legs.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Yeah...
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Why?
Paulie!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
Get that doctor.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
No dollar.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
...Ten minutes.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
How 'bout some Cokes?
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Yeah.
Do I have to pay juice?
Gonna try.
No -- Just me.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Hey --
Stuff it, man!
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I like yella teeth.
Maybe I like garbage.
I won't.
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Yeah, Kayo.
...No.
Yeah, sure.
Ya puttin' me on?
How do you mean?
Yeah.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Real good.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
Bullmastiff.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
...No.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
So where is it then?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
He's a Toon... who cares?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
I'll bet.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
What the hell's a freeway?
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
No...
Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
That's what you woke me up for?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
I've already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
Take it easy.
Divorce?  Never!
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Forget it.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Good idea.
Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Romeo will answer it?
The what?
Am I like Such a fellow?
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Young Romeo is it?
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Ahhh!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Well what shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
I thought all for the best.
NO! Mercutio!
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
What?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
So where do you go from here?
How do we know that?
That's why you were riding with him.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
It's been known to happen.
That's him.
You were a soldier, were you?
Duty calls?
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Don't do it, Sam!
In here...
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
A post office box.
There is one other thing...
Really?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
Call it a reckoning of character.
Is that right?
Why don't you go do better, then...
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Eat shit and die slowly...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I don't think so.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
To see a man about a thing.
As in, they own it?
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Gregor's cell phone...
You were smoking?
But you can't.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Dark ops?
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
You think?
Just like that?
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why not?
I'll work on it...
Gonna be tough.
You slept with the fucker!!
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
The Russian would be easier.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
None of them had any --
Dwayne listen to me -
The horniest dog in Nevada.
I hear you.
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
I don't know.
What's that?
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
There it is...now what about the others?
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
It's NOT too late!
How much?
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
You mean that guy was an agent?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Are you sure you're OK?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I love you too.
You deserve it is the occasion.
He's not, he's...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
Yeah.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Why would someone do that?
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Did you say After Midnight?
Is this marked money, or what?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Well I just uh, you know...
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
What?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
We're gonna talk.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
So someone did get away.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
What??  Where'd you hear that?
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
I don't think so...
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
That's right.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
Try to land on your feet.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
This won't take long.
How you doin'?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Don't look at my ass!
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Ask me if I give a shit.
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
You pull a muscle or something?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Gimme the binoculars.
She never even looked at you.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Fine by me.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
End of the line.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Dancing?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Yes.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
Just trying to make it look real.
Did you tell Sterling?
Thank you.
Don't.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Sir, I can explain.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Carter.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I was being polite.
What plate?
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Stooly.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Yee-aww.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
They put you in charge?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Han?
You have what I asked for?
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Carter, can I have a moment?
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
God bless you, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
His hair... any color.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Then come for dinner.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
No, I'm not.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
-- The luau for Maggie.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Highly suspect.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Can you fix it?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Me?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Where?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Quick.  Very quick.
Thank you, Dad.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
No, you tell her.
Is there somebody else?
So you're angry.  Big deal.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
No.
You couldn't.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
So what happened?
What?
About what?
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I should say something in this about magic.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
I always wondered about that too.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
Is this crazy?
He said hello.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Okay.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I want my money.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
What?
Magic.
What's she talking about?
Why not?
I don't know --
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Seventy... eight.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
What is it?
It's never happening again. Right?
So I can go.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Not now, Jonah --
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
No.
Was Mom an adjustment?
Shut up.
Get out.
If I didn't go.
It was all they had.
What about it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
What do you mean?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Hi.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
He's good at it.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
There's nothing stopping you.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
An American.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
They say I am no good to you.
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
What makes you so sure?
No.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Hunting.
Like what?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
You've got to help around the house!
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
Did you see his hair color?
You like that?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
What happened to your eye?
Like you?
I try.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It's me.
Please open the door, Danny.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
What?
You on a roll?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Not tonight.
No  You think she's a tweaker?
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
What does that mean?
Crank or glass?
Hey, okay.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
Yeah.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
What's he holding?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
And what does this have to do with me?
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Again, I thank you.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Maybe he isn't showing.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Thank you, sir.
Shit, that was no big deal.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
In the shadow by those two trees.
They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
To each, his own.
White-walls?
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
You know classical music?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
A machine gun.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Plenty.
Goddamn it, sir...
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
PUSH!
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Maybe.
Nope.
You're kidding yourself.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Let's just find someplace.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
I know.
I'll do my best.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Sure, Reiben.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Sure, what do you want to know?
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
That's a mystery to me.
What if our guys open up, sir?
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Alright, come with me.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Get lost.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Oh yeah!
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I know that.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
I like him a lot.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Yes, I...
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Thank you very much.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Pardon me?
No.
Yeah.
Today is tomorrow.
You think so?
What did you say?
This is so noble.
It was wonderful.
No, no.
No, I don't, I don't.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Fine Lloyd.
Yeah.  Honey?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you?
Very talented.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
I don't know.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
Sir, the list is correct.
Klaus Tauber.
Oskar, please -
They're not gone, they're here.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Yeah, what's that?
I pay you too much.
There's nothing in the stores.
Things are great, things are great.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Thank you.
What other point is -
No?
Would it do any good?
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
thought he was doing AA.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
What is it?
Stop it...
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
I live here.
You could start with an apology.
Did you do it?
You have a right to be angry.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
No, I don't.
Yeah.
Sid, you don't have to.
I'll get my jacket.
Let us decide that.
No. This is a set up.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Or it found us.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
I think you're all an act.
Over here.
He filmed his victims.
No, wait here.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Just in case...
That's not the way we play the game.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Are you in danger now?
I have to watch rehearsal.
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
You're not allowed to ask that.
But...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..harmonica style is okay.
Closer than you think.
But...
Shush.
Where you going?
Don't panic.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
I don't know.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Catch him, or kill him.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
What Rielly?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
No.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Fuck!
Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
I am Gale Weathers!
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
I'm hanging up right now.
What?  What movie?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Yes.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Are you sure?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
Oh...
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Yeah...
She looked dead. Still does.
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
You sleep in THAT?
I'll only stay a sec.
What are you doing here?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
You lost your mom...
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
To apologize.
You're making popcorn?
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Guess.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
You never told me your name.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
To talk.
You getting scared?
They'd never make it in time.
Or else what?
Sure...
Come on. It'll be fun.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Mind if I join you?
Sidney's father?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
...yeah...
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Have you contacted the bureau?
You think he could still be in town?
You want to go live?
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
I'll send you a copy.
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
What's your favorite scary movie?
So who are you?
Hello Sidney.
Can you knock?
Got it.
Don't shoot. It's me.
You got it.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
The why'd the police let him go?
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Wanna another beer?
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Are you serious?
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
It's past seven.
I'm not worried.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just like old times, ain't it?
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Come on, let's rock.
I don't know, they just did.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Give it to me.
So what?  This victim...
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
No, I haven't heard.
Yeah.
I heard.
He's not finished.
It would be too hard.
I'll see you.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Hello.
You'll see.
Spit it out.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Murderers like you?
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
Bear with me.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Bullshit.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
Oh, it's alright.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
It was him.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Then, he must write about these murders.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
Big surprise.
When do we get to question him?
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I will.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Wait!
I can't let you do this...
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
He mentioned it.
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
I ain't wearing no gun.
Dunno...Seems so.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
Just keep goin'...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Sir?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
I'm Clayton.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
You've done a lot of growin'...
Leggo...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
But I just bought a good blanket.
Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Not likely.
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Over there!
No...not yet...
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Only if I'm dead!
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
In the village.  Look what I found.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
What are you talking about-
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Tenth floor.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
The title won't do.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Yes.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Lady?
When I have fifty pounds.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Ten pounds.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Who is that?
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Put his feet in.
And his ears.
Partners!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Very well.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
What? Who?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
No, it will turn out well.
How goes it, Will?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Do you think?
The daughter of his enemy.
Mercutio…good name.
"Is the day so young?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Oh, but they can!
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Is she obedient?
You have opened the playhouses?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Who is there?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You lie.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
Nor you for me.
Write me well.
My lord.
You flatter, my lord.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
I . . .
Does she say so?
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
Why, thank you, David.
Can I show you something?
Think about it.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Is this necessary?
I don't know.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know.
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Well, yes.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Just serve.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
For the flat.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Yes.
What?
And now you tell me.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
You were magnificent.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
It's the only way.
Alex.
Burglary?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Who said there were four?
No, three. Who said there were four?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
That wasn't a question.
No.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
What?
With a face like this?
You and me?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
I'm boring?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
That guy, the one that died.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
A priest who dies.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No.
No. But he needs treatment.
You know about it?
And that's not the same thing?
That sounds fine.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
I mean, that's what it's like.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Why?
Yes, but... I thought...
That you were just indulging me.
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
What are you talking about?
No.
-- What?
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
You're looking great, baby.
What about?
Right now, I just don't care.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Hello.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Why?
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
I am not like my mother!
Great.
Great.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
Buffums?
Oh fuck, Norman!
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Yeah, I think so...
No, I'm sure.
Okay.
Great.
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And what?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
What are you talking about?
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
Fuckin' A --
You were great.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- mmm --
-- we are?
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
It's too late...
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't go, Jackie...
Don't leave me...
What?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Hey, stop by the shop.
What's gonna happen?
Well, like what?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
I am?
Yeah, baby.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Going where?
I'll call you.
Who?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
-- go ahead.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well, yeah.
I see.
In a way. But...
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Thank you.
When?
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
... this doing hair it's...
I don't know what to...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Well, what?
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
What can I say!
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
I know.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
No --
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
What?
No.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Then you were talking to him.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
That's not very logical, Lester.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Who is that?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Well, there was this one time --
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
He's a hairdresser.
Well... sure...
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
That's fine --
No, it's not that...
No.
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Yes, Dad.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I guess so.
What?
What do you mean?
Yes, Dad.
Yeah.
I'm not supposed to.
Try to think what it was.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Yeah.
No.
Yes?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Are you having a bad dream?
Oh!
Talking to Tony.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
I'm a Wendy.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Pleased to meet you.
Thank you for saying so.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Uh...huh.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Yes.
No, nothing at all.
I think he did it to himself.
Yes.
How do you like it?
I can't really remember.
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Why?
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
Yes?
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Not for me.
They'll love it.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Fine.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Sure, Uncle Al.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Let me help you up.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Will you?
Rats...
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
You want to know what I think?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
There! You see!
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Really?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
With love.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
Vince...
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Good evening, Vincent.
Yes, Betty?
Yes, Betty?
Right.
Not in years.
Chops?
Because we're
It's true -- I know her.
What a shame!
Um, I don't really know this one...
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Excuse me?
Are you sure?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Keep moving!
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Your name?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
What? 
Can do.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Your cell is more than adequate.
Come, Sister.
Mary Clarence!
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
I am?
What?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Saving you.  Move!
I'm a Christian.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
How?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
I think they'd understand.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
They open a window.
Who are you guys?
I'm telling you!
Which one?
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Neither did you!
For like, twelve zillion eternities?
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
We're losing it.
Yes?
He's decent.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
How did you hear this?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Two days... ?  For murder?
I hit him square.
What?
They need guidance.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Pardon me?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
A fine idea.
Master Hardenbrook...
Well... that might be... helpful.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
I know it.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
How could he?
The Western Woods.
Man or woman?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
Lady Van Tassel.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Yes, he does.  May I try?
You made this, and the drawings?
To avenge his father, and the others.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Just... keep where you are.
What did he say, Katrina?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
I do not know.  Away.
His horse.
No.  She has gone out.
Let her go!
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Yes.  Here...
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
I can't remember.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I like them french-fried potaters.
That boy wants me to.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Can I see him?
What you got in there, warshing?
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
It's too big.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
He does make some funny noises.
Please Doyle, don't.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Would y'all like that?
Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Childers.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
You told me to come by.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
All right then.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I don't reckon I know.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
You will? For sure?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm glad of it, honey.
He ain't ever okay to me.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I want to come back and stay here.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Yes sir.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
I know.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
It's my birthday.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
Better make it charge. 
I confess.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
What's the difference?
The Queen of England?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Yeah, I did.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
You got it.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
It means "happiness."
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You what?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
Sure thing. See you later.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
What does that mean?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
You mean Rashid?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
And his parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
You can't be more specific than that?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
Are you going to be all right?
You don't really want to know.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
No way.
I just did.
His only copy?
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Here, catch.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
Oh, yeh?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Well, it seems to me...
Why?  We're only talking.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Oh, in a heartbeat.
And the next one...?
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Tht was summation, Your H...
Twelve.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Carl Heine came.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
I have told the truth.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Yes.
Have a look.  At nothing.
You're right.  I better use two.
The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
I'll take two.  One for later.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
It is.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I already said that, b...
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
He had no reason to.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
No we're not.
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Shave our legs, stupid.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Now you've done it!
Tore off one of my chests.
Polish?
Down, Daphne!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
You - you -
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
That's right.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Get me Room 414.
Yeah - lets shove off.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
I'll say.
Stay as long as you'd like.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
Half-full.
What's the surprise?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
I'm just going to get some ice.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
I met one of them.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
- and you got to be girls.
Help yourself.
Me too.  Bye now.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Who?
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
We won't breathe a word.
Why?
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
Have you ever been with a male band?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Every time!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You are?
What's in Florida?
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
What theory?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
If it's at all possible -
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
I am?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Is it that hopeless?
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Booze.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
You and who else?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Why wouldn't I?
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Bacardi 151.
What? Why? What do you mean?
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Jeffrey told her last night.
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Yeah, kind of.
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
No.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
And you do now?
Doesn’t look like nothing.
No, tell me.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
You’re too good for him.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
This happened to you?
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Not dollars. Pounds.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Make out with you for free.
Hi.
Thank you.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Therapist.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Of course, don’t be silly.
Hi, kiddo.
Ahoy!
It’s complicated, Dad.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Sometime, but not like this.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
But where is my daddy!?
Nothin'...
She was dirty and wet...
No, Miss Johnson...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight to you, son...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
What's that, son?
Yes, David...
David!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Goodnight.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
Same as we -- they pray.
Good night...
Yes, mam...
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'm used to it.
They probly thought you was crazy.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Pillow.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Eric!
Very funny!
How the fuck should I know!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Something big, children.
Hey, Chef.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Fallen one... We have such sights to show you!
MPH RM!!!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Uhh... I don't know.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
For pooping, silly.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
We can't leave without you!
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah...
YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
Our moms suck!
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
-Or monkey fucker-
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Oh God... What have I done...
No, it was worse than that...
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
I know, Terrance. I know.
Canada is saving us!!
Terrance! NO!
Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
You don't care.
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Cool!
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Uh...
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
That's me.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
That's right.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Just considering our options... sir.
Why can't we?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
Wait.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Ready as I'll ever be.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Words to live by.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm about to blow the wall.
And so far.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
The engines!
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
What kind of man?
Can I get you something for the road?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
He's my dad.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
No kiddin'.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
I'm not on the tour this year.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
It's mine.
She's my mom.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
I couldn't care less.
He says that to all his wives.
I never saw you.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Hello, mom?
Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Junior who?
SHEILA!
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
I like the sport the way it is.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Look who's talking!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Line up where you want it.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Yippy!
I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
I'm not here to - I can't...
The mental hospital.
It's a vicious cycle.
No. Do You?
So, what about you?
Nothing.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It?
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Tell me what happened Theo.
Are you sure he's dead?
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
I'm not here to bowl.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
How about I just press the button?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
How long will that be?
Yeah.  I heard you.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
What team?
Press?  No, I haven't.
Storm?  What storm?
A thousand feet.
What?
Geologists?
Hold on --
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
When was this?
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Harry?  Can you copy?
They've left, keep watching!
In a minute, sir.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
Yes, Harry.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
Please watch your closest monitor...
How do you mean, strange?
It's not ignorant.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Radiation shield, you think?
Sir, about leaving --
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What about you?  What happened to you?
What?
You did, didn't you?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You don't trust me?
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Squids?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How do you spell it?
I'll just boost the doses.
Beth --
For what?
Where are you?
How's Harry?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
Don't you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Is it?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
By the bunks.
I never said that.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
I'm not being defensive.
Wait a second, I --
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
What noise?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
That far in what, Harry?
I thought she was with you.
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
I don't think so.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
You got her?
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Meaning?
Please.  It must have flown here --
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
Thank you.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Really?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
Huh?
You mean you don't know?
You mean a picture?
Unless it's an act.
Why's that?
Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Four.  Four years --
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
This isn't a game, you know.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
You could put it that way.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
How can you store an energy field within you?
Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
He can't find Organa Major.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
What's that?
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Was this trip really necessary?
Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Not enough, I guess.
Yes, sir !
Sir... I guess I do, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
You got it bad.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I got Games & Theory.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Only when I give you an order.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
They revoke our flight status.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
I don't want everyone to see.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Carl can wait.
I'll meet you outside.
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
I'll go for that.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
What happened to your eye ?
Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Hut... hut !
How come we never got together ?
No thanks, Diz.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
AAAAAAAAAAA !
Hi, mom.
Move out.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Uh, I don't know.
Good for you. Go find out.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
Who is V'ger?
You may proceede.
The Creator has not answered.
The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
You are what...?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
It's taken control of the computer...!
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Captain... I'd like to go along...
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
And whatever you sensed out here....
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Any reply from them?
Our... 'insignificance'?
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
There is no alternative.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Dock signals clear, Captain.
<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
I beg your pardon?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
I understand...
Goodbye.
Yes...
<u>Yes</u>...
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
I thought you had Play Practice.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Cast stood me up.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better idea...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
You have to sign for it.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
I can't get it to come out right.
<u>Please</u>...
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
You'd do the newspaper right here.
I'm going to tell the truth.
If I go to jail...?
We'll work it out...
Well, then, what's he doing here?
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
...they run on water.
On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
She wasn't in the...
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
I don't eat vegetables.
I swear that that woman in my room...
We've got three days to...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...
It's night.
There's other things to be learned.
Then what is the...?
I wasn't in the car.
I, actually yes.
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
Is...Is the Movie!
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
Yes.
We, we have to give it.
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I'll put the, in your r...
I can't tell.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
My wife just went into labor...
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
I can only write on a manual.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I know you do.
I hurt my finger.
You want me to lie.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I don't know.
I don't...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
<u>Pay</u> her.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
If you do the product placement...
Is that one hell of a kid?
Sherry, Sherry...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
So we just got lucky.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Mmm...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I killed her!
I don't care.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
During sex.
I live.  In the same country.
What are you gonna talk about?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Like how?
And...?
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Maybe twenty.
I'll miss you so much.
Here.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
This is my daddy's house --
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
But Rache...
You owe me a quarter.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
How do you know?
Rache can do that part.
But you can still see him.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Every day.  More and more.
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
I'm here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
I'm worried.
And I'm supposed to care.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Look, I...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
She was angry at herself.
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Don't flatter yourself.
Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Ironic, huh?
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Thanks, but it's under control.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Don't be too sure.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Worked.  Like a charm.
That's not wh...
Oh please.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
You're the hip and fresh.
You'll learn.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Does Jackie know this?
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Maybe he's gay.
Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God's will.
I did not go to high school.
We had to work. My family was poor.
No.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
Fine.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
I'm going in there.
Just the same.
Well, now you have.
Uh huh.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
No.
Thanks.
'Fuck me hard!'
Again!
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Hunh.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I know.
Yeah?
He did?
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
We're outta here--
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
What happened?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
It's nothing to worry about.
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
She's still alive.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What the hell is it, anyhow?
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Moffo!
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
See!  See, I told you.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
That's government property, Major.
General Schmuck?
No, sir.
What kind of trouble?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Condition Red!
A shooting war!
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Thank you, sir.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
Ask away, Major.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
I presume the planes are armed?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
What the hell is Plan-R?
Admiral Buldike?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
They're coming in now.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Maybe it's an exercise.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Call them every five miles.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
I think they mean business.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Seond safety.
Check, ten thousand air burst.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Everything still checks out okay.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
What do you mean?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
But who would be chosen?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Intense.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Was it okay?
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
Now?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Yeah.
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
So you can do an album cover?
What, they're looking for her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Erica is in the van back there.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Guess not.
Jeff! Let's go!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Yeah.
In what way?
Alright, Pony!
I can come visit?
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Don't drop the guitar, man.
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Mm.
Let's see.
Yeah?
Taking care of business.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
We were?
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Because I'm alienated.
Who were you talking to?
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Ask your girlfriend.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Will you just put the gun down?
Just put it down.
Seven-twenty.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
I don't know. I think she's breathing.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Like what?
But do you stand for anything?
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Typical male.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Tim!
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Sooze.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Us.
And?
Mm-mm.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Is that a threat?
Shit, Jeff!
Wait. What, what are you saying?
'Bye, Jeff.
What?
Just go.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Like songs?
Well, not exactly.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Oh, my god!
About what?
She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
Don't do that, man, okay?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Come on, Jeff.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
Oh that's nice for you.
No car.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
I just pulled and it - it came off.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Sorry, Kansas...
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Bye.
You sure?
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Hold on...
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
But you're not married.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
My what?
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
I didn't mean to --
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Close, but no cigar.
I'll take it.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
How about the Rainbow Room?
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Phillip, you're mad!
You'll be waiting for me?
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
You did?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I'll make it short.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
You're tough, all right.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
What were you -- a child actress?
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Twenty-two.
I don't want it now.
This is where you live?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Where do you live?
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
You can stay here.
Just a scene I cut out.
Okay.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Yes, Norma.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Go on in.
The doctor suggested it.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
No?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
All right.  Camera!  Action!
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
It's what we were warned about.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
She didn't take it from you, did she?
What do you want?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
Who didn't?
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Tell me where I can find her.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Just like that?
But why?
But I don't understand.
I don't see why not.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
She has hostages.
How do I fight it?
Well, there's several ways to go .
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
I'll drink to that.
And you think you're in love.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't want your help.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
I've got things to do.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Oh, sure.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
You're not...an orphan are you?
It was just a trim.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
What? Me?
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Not yet.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Criminals.
If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
I knew it!
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Brad.
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
I seem to be.
Who?
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
There's a lot of choices here.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Sure.
Say!
Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
At one o'clock in the morning?
Gus Gorman.
Yeah.
What about this week's check?
Say what?
Say who?
Or socks.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
God, that's what I keep you for.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Fair's fair.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
You just did, with that great dinner.
But the bridge...
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Diet soda?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
You've got to pick three more numbers.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Be my guest.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
What??
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Let's get you inside . . . .
I'm sorry.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Everything on it.
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
To ski?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
What shall we do now?
Sentimental idiot.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
If you say so. Here goes.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
I'm not so sure you do.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Absolutely!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Daddy . . . ?
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
. . . And  very naïve!
Superman gets mail here?
Something . . . wonderful.
A toupee that flies?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Get the box, nephew.
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
This wasn't in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
First, I have fun.
Destiny.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Nobody else.
We're running out of smoke.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
Got it? Otis?
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
I know son, I know...
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Oh.
Don't you ever give up?
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Not unless you can fly.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Screaming
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
You think he's for real?
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I read the article.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
We just take it?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
There was a recipe on the back  --
I know...
Tea?
What other one?
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
Folks'll ask question.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
He'll be weightless.
He will be odd, different.
Twenty-four.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Thirty-five.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Very much.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
We'll see how fast I can fly.
Alison Jones.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Are you still in touch?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
It turns to steaming piss.
Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
No you don't.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Yeah.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
I better get back.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
You believe that?
Why?
Well I don't.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Did they give him special care?
That would complicate things.
I did.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Yes.  It's a present.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Did he say what about?
What's a ditty again?
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
I won't lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Thank you, Nicole.
No.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Yes.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.
I need money.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
What is it?
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
Who did they get for that?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
In what way?
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Really?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
But you didn't lose me.
There's talk of that.
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I doubt that it matters any more.
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
No...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Can I come in for a minute?
I have a message from your sister.
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
Can't hurt...
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
The man in jail is always for freedom.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Can you be there by two-thirty?
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
What kind of an act is this?
The renting agent and the tailor.
I hate to see you like this --
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
I know you do, Sidney.
Why not you?
You tell him, I stutter!
Yes, but why?
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
If the stores are open -
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Those lying motherfuckers!
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Max.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
Why?
Right.
Cool.
Smile?
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Remember what I said, you can't...
I'm sorry, John.
I have to go away, John.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Alright, it!  We need it!
Open the goddamn door!
Why him?
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
Please continue...
On all what?
But I promised your mother.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
That is correct.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
May I ask a question?
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
Tell me about von der Null.
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
What?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
Helmuth.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
The Miracle Kid.
Sure.
Come to the office, please.
You're late.
I won't let the fat kid down.
Wrong.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I hate the beige one.
I thought you did.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
I volunteered.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
That's not my mission.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
I want it to be over for you.
Good fighters.
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Please, don't do that...
It was an accident.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
You first.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Can we talk?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
Get out of my car!
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
What are you talking about... ?
Scams, con games.  How many?
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Nicholas...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
We searched the house.
What are you doing?
No...
Like... where are you from?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Fun?
Are you still on mediction?
You dodged a bullet.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
Robbed?
There's nothing to forgive.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
What's all this for?
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Like, this way... sort of...
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Ilsa... you're alright?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
No.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
You know you can.
Attempted murder.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
What?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Sure.
Just stay there, Nell!
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
Luke.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
Where in the hell can she be.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
It was.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Why?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
How'd I know it was for you?
Good.
That?  That's Hill House.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
How could you do this to people?
Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
She was unhappy.
No one will come any nearer than that.
It's all I could afford.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
I know.
You're okay.
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Well?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I don't know, you know...
I think so.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Is that a problem?
What kind of food?
I'm sorry.
Who?
We all did.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why not?
Not bad.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
Lookin' good.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
No reason.
Terry Valentine.
Did Jenny know?
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
What post office?
Not much -- you?
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Been busy, have you.
That's not what I heard.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Try calling me again.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not embarrassed.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
My employer.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
Hey?
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
You ever been to London?
What'd your father do?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
All of what?
And that is?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
He had urgent business in the north.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Yeah?
No kidding.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Yeah.
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
So what.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Something's on.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Walked.
-- You know his name is Frank.
You know I don't live with him.
Ah.
I don't.
Be seein' you.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Who?
Hello, Tony.
We've certainly missed you.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
That's what he keeps telling me.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Huh.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Birdy--
That right.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Yeah.
Cash.
Sure.
It's OK.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Mm.
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
Big Dave--
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
...OK.
It was Big Dave's.
*I* was with her.
...who among us is in a position to say...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Uh-huh.
What the--
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
No thanks, I--
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
We're just closing, friend.
Could you come with me please?
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
Homicide.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
I appreciate that.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
What's the combination?
Let's go!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
You're kidding.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Got my hands full here.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
I don't believe it.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
Frock's been fired.
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
I don't understand.
A monster?
What happened?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Where did you see it?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
He gave it back to his father.
Why would we--
Do it!
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
Amnesia.
Certainly a nomination.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Oh, yes.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
So when are you leaving?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
Your Dad?!
This is where it started.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
What's that?
Good night, Mother.
Oh, my God!
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
Do something...
Truman, stop it!
Well, I made it through another night.
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
When you get to Fiji?
Fine.  I'll tell her.
Were you there--how do you know?
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Yup.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
What's that?
Show you right on a map.
I know the name. Why?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
Do you?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
I'm not sure. A virus --
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
You're looking for a bomb.
How's that?
Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
All I told them was the truth.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
No.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Get dressed, Scully.
According to this tag.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Evidence of a massive infection.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
I have no idea.
You can't quit, Scully.
Where are we?
Thank you.
How deep does this go?
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
What do you mean, walked?
Driver.
A pocketful of rye...
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Yes mother.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
I don't need them anymore...
I realize that...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
Peter, okay?
What did you see?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I did, yeah.
What happened to Charles Gish?
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
That hoist, with the winch...
Delano?
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
Initiating connection.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
I'll get her...
No.
No.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Dr. Kent.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Ja, ja, ja.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Whiskey.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Just another part I've got to learn.
What's that?
I'm so sorry.
Why?
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
How did you know I would be here?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I saw him today.
No.
Two weeks ago.
It's true then?
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
When did you see him last?
What?
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Thank you. Excuse me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
No, no. Leave them for a while.
No, a major, were you really?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Yes.
At the end of every chapter --
But he said he died instantaneously.
But you will.
Hear the details.
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Mr. Lime - yes.
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Who else?
Yes.
You don't mean that doctor?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
He didn't want to get involved.
Joseph Harbin.
Never.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Okay.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Thanks.
I don't think so.
Why?
So how many miles do you think it is?
What!
Yes.
Eh - bonsoir.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
He's an asshole.
That's a movie, you moron.
Who the fuck are you?
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Why the fuck not?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Oh, really?
Why won't you talk to me?
He's at a home out here.
What do you care?
Oh, yeah... 
What's it mean?
Why?
V'asitem...
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Do they?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'll go look....
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
It's the truth....
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
A poison...?
Female...
Are all Jews the same?
So you're saying it's not true.
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
To hear them read Torah.
I can't help what I think.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
You're lying.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
So what Jew would you kill first?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
That's meat.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
What kids?...
Who told you that?
The mother.
Here...
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
So what do we do with the device?
Where?
Wow, that's uh...great...
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
Dennis Leary.
No.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
I was just trying to make a point. If --
But your man isn't quite a God!
... So am I.
Italian is practically the same thing.
Yes.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Six seconds.
Have the car painted.
Then tell him to wax it too.
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
No...
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
... For the mermaids.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
Yes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
You say that because you have the title!
Well that's very nice of you.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
We saw each other a little while ago.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
... Okay.  I'll try.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
... The way she moves.
Uh... Yes, of course!
Why?
No... tell me.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
I saw how it has to be.
... Are you sure?
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Johana... New York.
He doesn't hear too well.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Louis, we were French!
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
You called the police?
What's your first move?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
C'mon follow me.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
That depends. How much money has he?
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Let me see it ——
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Good evening.
Yes?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
We're old friends.
About Charlie's leopard?
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
I thought they came right past here ——
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Now look what you've done.
Yeah.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
I know. Funerals.
What! You can't be --
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
Must it?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Excuse me?
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
You don’t say.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Should I?
Get to the point, will you...
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Croissants.
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
Yeah.
I know where to look.
A criminal?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
What sort have you got?
Tomorrow?
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
...On holiday?
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
How are you, Jane?
La what?
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
Yes. How did...
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Recommended?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Jah...
Does it matter?
Shut up and drive!
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Can I get up now?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Er... Yes...
How’s the boy doing?
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
I know his work better than I know him.
What about his girlfriend?
Cinq cents.
Alors quoi?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
If he had, you’d be dead.
What do you think, huh?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
That’s what he said...
Cost what?
Majesty, I can't...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Well...
You make it sound so simple...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
Not yet!
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
I'm staying, Jean.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Quite a few.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
And when was that?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Am I... am I dead?
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Last night.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
He's feeling wonderful.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
The wind will be against us...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Yes, but...
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Here -- take this instead.
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Why not?
What do you mean, they won't come?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
So your memory's coming back?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
Do you think you are ready?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
And what does he say to you?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Oh, yes. I remember.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
Wladek, please.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
He'll be back before curfew.
Let's find out.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What's happened?
What, I'm working, what?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What?
Who told you?
Who's recruiting?
Do they?
We use what?
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Just shut up.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
You'll be deported.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
There are always notices going up.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I was listening, Kitten.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
God forbid!
No, I don't think so?
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Like it were a piano?
No sound at all?
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Ohh the tag is broken.
No, no bible readers.
Yes, I thought that.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No.
You mean in signs?
Spoken words?
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
That's right.
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
No.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
You think my play is bad?
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
Shove off, Duff.
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
Which one?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
You sober?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
We'll get by without 'em.
I never played for winos.
Neither are we.
What do ya mean?
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
I also gotta win.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
The name is Lonnegan.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Where's June today?
Yeh, sleepin'.
What the hell for?
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
All right, when?
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
No.
I'll make parole.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Nothing.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Go!
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
And I'll give then proof!
Hello, there!
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Macaulay.
tried him once -
Oh, thank heaven.
Where did you hit her?
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
He's been dead for three months.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Gilbert!
What's that to you?
No.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
No.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
I'll take care of him.
Did you go?
I see.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
You've said that for weeks.
I said all right!
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Go ahead!
What did you do with the rest?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Good.
That's all right.
Is Julia going with you?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Hello, Mimi.
Well, don't you?
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
They'll want more than your word for that.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
This is your party.
Hello, baby.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
I'll get some towels. 
Well, didn't you?
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Yes.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
He was down in the shop.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Huh?
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Police!
No... no.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Yes.  Nick!
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
I know I left them there.
I'm fired.
It's a fortune box.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
I heard!
I told you; don't push me around.
No.
And let me guess who is.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
What are you doing?
Blow me.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
I got that...sir.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
Something like that.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
We're not going to do anything.
So where do we start?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
What?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Wes is dead!
Damn.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
And then what?
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
I don't know!
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
We go this way.
But...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Yeah.
Thanks.
What?
Really?
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
A headache?
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, God!
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Correct.  Origin?
Permant cortex bond.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
You've seen enough.
Eat your dinner.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't be so sure.
It's 3+27 hundred
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What?
But...you...
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
No!...No!...
THX and me.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
I want you for my roommate.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
But you can't...you.
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
All right...
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Go ahead.
You the Bomb Squad?
What do you mean?
Thanks.
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
Mike Reilly.
I don't know. You tell me?
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Your partner?
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Right.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Taylor's dead.
Alex-
Security.
Nothing... just tired.
Stay in the truck.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Nothing so far.
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
It's about this.
Huh?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
And it had diamonds in the back.
And diamonds in the front.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
erect in sweater, arms folded.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
No.
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
I thought so.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
No, not at all!
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Gaston Monescu.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
He recognized you!
Spanish passports?
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Lily-- 
I know that niche.
Oh! You didn't read it!
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
No. What is it? Tell me.
What?
You think that's too much?
That sounds sensible. 
Ye-es?
You're hired!
Um-hum ...
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
Like that?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I <u>must</u> go.
I know it.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Please! 
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, Gaston?
<u>Adolph</u>?
Goodbye.
I know!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
I don't want your money!
That's right.
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
The ship will sink.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Lewis...
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
Not the better half.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
I know what ice fishing is!
Could I speak to you in private?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Just some sketches.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Sure. If you like.
Just move with me. Don't think.
A mistake?
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
You're right. Only you can do that.
Au contraire, mon cher.
Could it have damaged the ship?
He couldn't have.
I promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Isn't that interesting?
Where's Lother?
Not at all.
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Fine--I'll be glad to.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Yes--
Good-by.
Good-by!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Okay.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
You mean that?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
What's the matter?
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Where did you hide it?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Hey!--you're tickling me.
She did?
How?
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Send that.
Knots!
She's in New York.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
Do what--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Why?
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
It all depends on what you're used to.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Absolutely nothing.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
No...
Here it come: one-two-
Enough?  Never.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
But who was the Devil?
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Ignore her?
In vino veritas.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
But Doc-
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
How you feelin', Doc?
All right, Doc...
Then what do I do?
What?
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Awful lot of money.
I know.  Me neither.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
You'd die for fun?
I laugh sometimes
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No really, I can stay a while.
All right, well, good night.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
You wanted to talk?
Forget it, Ringo.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
So he can tell the story.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
But she doted on the frowner
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
So why did you leave?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Nothing.
Do you?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
How is old Q?
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
That's reassuring.
I didn't think so.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Let's not make it a habit.
- The family jewels?
- You're not.
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
What?
My father left me the business.
Only what I read in the newspapers.
'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Captain Morton.
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
What's wrong?
...I see.
Excellent.
You come with me -  You stay here.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Who is it?
Since when?
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Yes.
They're too big.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
You were in hell?
What for?
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Now how far would further out be?
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Now who are we talking about?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
That's nice.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
But Mom, I can't find him!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
What?  What is it?
Rocky!  The ramp!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
That's why.  Sid.
You mean that happy child?
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
But why would Andy want me?
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
I got dibs on his hat!
Miss.  G-6.
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
She's sick!
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Nothing.
You murdering dog!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
I was close to being scared that time.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
I thought he was at summer camp!
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
Sir!  No Sir!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
I can't quite make out -- 

It's busted.
Speed up!
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Get away from me...
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
It was only a mouthful!
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
So did I.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Nine thousand dollars.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Barbara --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
No, not yet.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
I don't know.
What do you think?
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I get A's.  All A's.
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Who do you work for?
We're playing!
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
That thought makes me feel awful.
So go shower already.
I don't know, sir.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
No.
Javier Rodriguez.
It was an anonymous tip.
Everybody has a weakness.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Any way we can do it better?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Like you protected Landry?
I'll get there as soon as I can.
No. On you go.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Can you not go yourself.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Did you bring the cards?
Diane.
I'm going home.
What?
Eh-
Out.
No, not holding hands.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
No.
Aye.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Cheers.
Nightmare.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Give me the gun.
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
He made me lick it.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Are you serious?
Your usual table, sir?
As you wish.
No joy yet.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Rescued at last.
Position, Bird of Prey?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Because it's there.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Are we leaving, Captain?
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Doctor.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
Why?
Yes, Captain.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
I did not.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
It must be all those marsh melons.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
I'm afraid of nothing.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
The ship needs its Captain.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...


  
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
I'm certainly not.
Hello, Alan.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Alan. Alan Bailey.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
End of line.
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Hah.
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Why? What are you going to do?
Shhhhh.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Tron...?
Alan-One...
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
Then I owe you some thanks...
I'm shocked.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Where are you off to young lady?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Why?
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Yeah, right.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
What are you talking about?
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Sorry.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
You're not going anywhere.
Yes sir.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Oral hygiene?
You're damaged goods, lady.
I'll handle it.
What'd you do, honey?
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
No.
Do you still love your husband?
Yes or no.
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
No.  Doris.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Yup.										*
God, you have great legs.
Yes.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Go ahead.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
I'm married!
I don't know.  I have to think...
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Helen.
I just glances inside.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
How come?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Want some Goobers?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Is that your real name? Really?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
What do you want to know?
What do you do?
Where are you from.
What's your favorite movie star?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
My pimp.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
What?
That rhymes.
Heard that.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
So you do eat pussy!
You wanna get unhaunted?
He don't got no right to live.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
I'm her husband.
No thanks.
Get the fuck outta here!
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Every word of it.
Elliot.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
What are we gonna see?
Want an animal cracker?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
You are the dumbest person in the world.
No. No you're not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Not a tiny little vial -
You're no longer an extra -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Yeah, I live here.
Uh, I didn't hear the...
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
What's she doing?
So that...???
I need to go now.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
Underground.
It's so clean.  No germs.
No more drugs.  Please...
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
What?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
I've got one now.
Jeffrey Mason?
Shot!  Who shot you?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
I'm not crazy.
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
How did you find me?
Hey, man...
Yes, sir.
Might be tight.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Christ no!
That's 'cause he's dead.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
That's my morning's pay.
Will be.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
So?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
What?
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
The wind isn't blowing.
What happened to your hand?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
Thank you.
What?
Like you.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Yeah.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
What was I supposed to do?
There has to be!
No.
You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You killed him!
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
He was going to--
But you said we could be together.
But I want to say with you,
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
John Stewart.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would I what?
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I was hoping we could talk.
I need thirteen.
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Trouble with the car again?
Darrell giving you problems?
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
You're not talking sense.
I said come on!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
She's dead.
How old are you?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Oh, shit!
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
But, Senor--
Senor, you need a doctor.
You want something, old man?
You can't do that yourself?
That's 'cause he's dead.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
...And everything is nothing too.
Who's cursed?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Yeah...
An overheated car.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would I what?
I did?
You're talking like a madman.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
Yep.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Time.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
You've been there?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
No! No police.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I have an idea.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
How do you know he's still not here?
No.
Try me.
Yeah.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
What are you talking about?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You could give me my gun back.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
'Cause I love you.
Harlin's.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
One way.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
No baby, you got it wrong.
You didn't hear something?
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Wow.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
I'll keep it in my office room.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
Yes.
Yes.
What was that?
Seventy-five percent.
What was your idea Elijah?
You're skill.
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
We are.
Yes he is.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Just one--
I'll help you.
No.
No.
I mean if you knew karate?
Two hundred and seventy.
I see.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
No?
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Advances?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
She back in Kansas?
Be careful with those, sonny.
He admit it?
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
What's your name?
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Uh... Duke.
But he was called...
And?
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
Give it to him.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
I could of... easy.
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Huh?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
I can't see 'em.
Yeah?
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Lemmee see it.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
You ain't like that no more.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
How far kin you see?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
The Kid, yeah...
Did I what?
What?
Who said that?
Nothin's bent.
You gonna share your half with him?
He's blind, for Chri...
Plenty of times.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We'll bury him.
Just like that?
Yeah?
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Umm ...
This whole thing was a shakedown.
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Can we stealth these guys?
I can run. I got no problem with that.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Well, I'm sorry.
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
What time is it?
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
I shivved him.
Tell him we'll meet.
What'the fuck is that?
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
Which is shit.
What?
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
He loved her.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT.

Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Right.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
Why lie about everything else, then?
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Very good.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
How did you settle on the amount?
You thought it was just.
It looks that way.
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
Tell me one?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
That's right.
Well, we...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Just as you are, Sir...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Huh!
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I . . ..
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
There's nothing they can do to me.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No, you did fine.
I.  Yes.  It is.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
... and you're going to do that?
You're going to settle out of court?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
No.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...things change.
Thank you for seeing me.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
What?
Mr. Alito, please.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
Who told you that?
And what makes you so tough?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is that to you...?
I have to talk to you.
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
You use their witness.
What did she do?
I don't know.
I don't want a mistrial.
It's locked.
... You saw her?
She did?
In New York?
Mrs...
Yes.
Yeah.
As I've said we had some more...
Huh.  And why is that?
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I married into it.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
No.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
It's not my line.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
What for? Who are you?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
-- and how you happen to be living here.
I want to know who you are.
Dinner... and what else?
An hour?
Can I see you tomorrow?
I'll take care of you.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Yes.
Is that the best you can do?
How does it work?
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
Take me away...
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Well... anywhere in particular?
Knowing I have to die...
No birds live here.
Yes...
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No!
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
I know.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
I'm here, I've got you...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
To the church, I must go there.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Carlotta Valdes?
Would you please go and look?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
I've never run across one like that.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
What.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
And she died...
Nothing to tell.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Carlotta?
Where?
Did you need it?
Oh?
Can we have it by tonight?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
First of all...
Why?!
You're pathetic.
You're not a team player.
You're a loser.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
You don't know what you're doing.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
What about the blood?
I can't do this.
At the seven-eleven.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
Adam! Calm down.
They won't figure it out.
They're driving me nuts!
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No. I think it's fucked.
Don't ever stare him down.
There's more.
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Shut up.
Good God...Good God...
He's having a problem here.
What did you ask me?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
And what happens when you can't?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
You will not screw this up.
We're not goosed.
What?
I don't think so.
I think so.
I think I forgot the tent.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
Why? What's his problem?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
With all my heart.
Okay.
Hi.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
Okay.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
I'm working on it.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Now?
Yeah. You.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
It's too late.
But...
What money?
The only proof is those bodies.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
He's your brother.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
I don't hear it.
I think so.
A move?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
That's what I'm thinking.
The stone age.
That's our plan.
I don't think that's a good idea.
That one.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Who is she?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Evil.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Nothing.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Do they worry you that much, then?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
A black bull came.
Very, very?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I had so many things to think about!
When you are, miss.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
I have a headache.
Me? What did I do?
Why wasn't I told?
I'm getting by.
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Got it.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
This is supposed to be years away.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
That's not true, Parker.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
How did you get your hand out?
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
This is my area of expertise.
Nothing.
This isn't a game, Parker!
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
Part of him is.
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...

Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
You gonna git me back tomorrow?  Cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
...how ya feeling, boy?
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Why Albania?
The... 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
...it's a Teaser!
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
All the greater accomplishment.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Why not?
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
...but...
Watch me.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
Better.
I believe in you....
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Then get out and close it behind you.
Start unloading.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
...Work okay?
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
We are?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
...I can't even see it...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Obviously...
Oh yes, I remember you.
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Any better and I'd be guilty.
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
You got it, G.G.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
Yeah, yeah, OK
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Hi
Thank you
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Maybe before the event, never after.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
You guys are being real assholes
It's only two hours away.
You're joking.
Mm-hmm.
Yes, but...
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Do you?
I don't know.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
This fence...it's so...
Wait!  Don't go...
What?
Please leave me alone.
She never mentioned her father.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
What?
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
I don't know.
Jody, wait.
I think so
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Hartford?
What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Three o'clock.
Nice.  Almost done.
Fine.
Not the focus.
After that.
Of him I think.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
Unless you need me to come home...
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What's going on, Claire?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Well, that's a relief.
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
I will NOT.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You told me that I was...
Not personally.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
What?
Oh God...
So you fucked a student?!
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
You should have tried harder.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
Nothing.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
:Well, they are.
I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Every day  twice.
He made that quite clear, yes.
Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
When did she die...?
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Stop it!
ENOUGH!!!
I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
If you knew how I yearn for that...
Go away!  I don't want you here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
I don't know what you are!!!
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
I'm glad you're around to say it.
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
Hello..
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Mm-hmmm...
Did you see the old man on the ---
I love you too.
Your beneficence.
Lock the door.  Lock it
A bit much.    Lucas.
What were you talking about...?
Gotcha.
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
You can't just -
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
The one on the left - definitely...
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
BRIAN...
Where do you kill them...
I don't know...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Why should I?
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Did you?
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Open it...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
I am sorry...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Don't worry about it -
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Well, Dad said...
Maybe he got promoted.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
We reinvented ourselves.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
So you'll think about it?
So that's a maybe?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
I guess.
Yeah.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Whatever you want.
What do you want me to do?
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
I understand.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Your article sucked.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Interesting.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
To the best hiding place in the world.
He didn't. He had it built.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Well? Where the hell are you?
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Not a chance.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Yellow pages?
You better.
Only the best for my mother.
But how would we pay our bills?
Oh. Goodness.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Tipping?
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You think we should be more open minded?
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Take your time.
I'd like that.
Suzie Toller is missing.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
The skinny brunette.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
We don't know that, Ray...
Ray, you heard him...
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
Where's Lombardo?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
What about witnesses?
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Yeah... okay... he did
I'm sorry?
Your Honor... Please...
Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
Lombardo ever come out here?
What brain?
Shit.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
Where, the mall?
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
So you got my mom's money.
Why can't you come...
Hello.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You can't...
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
That's cop bullshit.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Sit down, Lombardo.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Wouldn't dream of it.
I'll work on it.
What about the explosive?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
It's better than nothing.
He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Oh, thank you.
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
I've had some practice.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Private train?
My friend?
That'll be all, boys.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
He had a pressing engagement.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Who was this partner of his?
It is?
They're coming.
You're not going to use it, are you?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Just get me some horses.
Me?
What is Tir Asleen?
Not today, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Let me see it.
Why not?
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Why.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
Willow!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
How are we going to get out there?
Cows. You know, cows?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
They're Amish.
I thought I was the English.
Yes, sir.
Who'd you see?
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No pistol. Ever.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
We do not go into your courts.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
I can't.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Only the elders.
What?
But you can't.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Something wrong with buttons?
Anything against zippers?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
There was.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Say again?
I don't know where he is.
Yes.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
That is idle talk.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
All right, where is he?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
I don't believe you!
Ohhh!
No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Uh-huh.
Oh, no -- no!
Oh...
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
You're right -- I am a coward.
Yes.
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Huh?  What'd he say?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Ohhhh --
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
This way!  Come on!
Yeah --
Don't push!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Ohhhh -- it's me!
To Oz!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Ho -- ho --ho
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Th.D.?
Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
Help!
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Elektra would control it all.
If I don’t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden’s Tower, M is dead.
But what if...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
I could come for a second opinion?
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
You knew him well?
I’m sorry.
Yes.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
No.
I know.
Really?
Shush.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
You can drop the act, it’s over.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Please.
Of course...
Yes.  Au revoir...
What?!
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
Washington?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
Mm hmm.
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Because --
Jon -- what??
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
The missing scientists.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What is it?  How does it work?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
-- What?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names.
I don't know their real names!
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
What do you get if you finish?
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
You can't talk to it?
Nice place to start, don't you think?
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Been to any good diners lately?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
I don't like him being here.
We have to find Magneto.
Into the Hudson?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
What if I like the pain?
By reading my thoughts?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
Were you now?
He takes his work seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
I'll go.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
From your office, sir.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
I did, sir.
I...
You bet your boots it does.
Goodbye, darling!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Yes!... the laboratory.
This is the only library I know of.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Why did you do that?
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
No, Fred ereck.
What hump?
Home.
I wonder what's got into them?
Just putting up some tea.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Was he any good?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Why?
Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
Wait till he sees the bill.
careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Can you play it?
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Yes!
Raise the platform, hurry!
I think I'll...carry him.
Me?  Sing?
Are you serious??
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
I see what you mean.
Of course not.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Four
Yes.
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Which one?
Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
